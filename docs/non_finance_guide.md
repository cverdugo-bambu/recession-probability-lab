# Non-Finance Starter Guide

## What this project is doing
- It estimates the chance of a U.S. recession in the next few months.
- It uses public data and past history to produce a probability, not a guarantee.

## How to interpret the probability
- 5% means low risk right now, not impossible.
- 40% means elevated risk and worth closer monitoring.
- 70%+ means historically high concern.

## Three numbers you will see
- Precision: when the model warned, how often it was right.
- Recall: of real recession periods, how many the model caught.
- F1: a balance between precision and recall.

## What to do monthly
1. Open the dashboard and read `Current risk` and `Latest nowcast`.
2. Check `Monthly Explanations` for what changed.
3. Review `2008 vs Current Period` to compare stress patterns.
4. Track if probability is trending up for several months in a row.

## Important mindset
- Use model outputs as a decision aid.
- Combine with human judgment and multiple sources.
- Focus on trends over time, not one month in isolation.
