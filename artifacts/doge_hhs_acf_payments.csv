The total reimbursement amount requested is $3,301,330.72, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU058202 supports the delivery of Home Study and Post Release Services (HS/PRS) to Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) nationwide. The purpose of this program is to ensure that children released from ORR custody to sponsors are placed in safe, stable, and supportive environments, and that they receive continued monitoring and support during their adjustment and immigration proceedings.
	•	Home Studies are in-depth assessments conducted prior to a child’s release to evaluate the sponsor’s ability to provide a safe and suitable environment. These include comprehensive interviews, home inspections, and background checks in accordance with federal policy.
	•	Post Release Services are provided after reunification to ensure continued safety and well-being, including linkage to community services, school enrollment, and legal support.

A critical component of this program is the identification and mitigation of risks related to trafficking, abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Staff are trained to assess for red flags during both home studies and post-release visits. In cases where safety concerns or trafficking indicators are identified, NYAP adheres to mandated reporting requirements and actively partners with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to ensure appropriate intervention, investigation, and protection of the child.

NYAP provides HS/PRS across all 50 states and U.S. territories, leveraging a national network of trained professionals who respond quickly to referrals and deliver trauma-informed, culturally responsive care coordination.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $2,327,469.39
Covers case managers, supervisors, intake staff, and clinicians who provide home study evaluations, post-release visits, risk assessments, and case management across the national network.

Fringe – $345,896.06
Includes employer-paid benefits such as health insurance, payroll taxes, and retirement contributions for HS/PRS program personnel.

Supplies – $2,023.38
Includes materials necessary for assessments and case management, such as mobile technology, child safety materials, office supplies, and documentation tools.

Other – $125,307.89
Includes interpreter services, external background checks, community referrals, and other necessary program-related services not covered under other categories.

Travel – $207,597.52
Supports in-person home study and post-release visits, including transportation and lodging for staff serving rural or hard-to-reach areas to ensure nationwide coverage.

Administrative/Indirect – $293,036.48
Covers operational oversight, IT systems, reporting, compliance, and general administration required to manage and deliver the program at a national scale.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses included in this request are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with ORR’s mission and policy. These costs support NYAP’s ability to perform timely home study assessments and deliver high-quality post-release services nationwide. The program actively prevents trafficking and abuse through front-end screening and follow-up care. In compliance with federal and program policy, NYAP promptly reports safety concerns and actively collaborates with law enforcement partners as needed to ensure children’s protection.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Home Study and Post Release Services program, are implemented in accordance with federal policies and align with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Safeguarding unaccompanied alien children before and after release
	•	Preventing exploitation, trafficking, abuse, and neglect through pre- and post-placement screening and monitoring
	•	Partnering with law enforcement for mandated reporting and child protection
	•	Ensuring court compliance and connection to legal and support services
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes while promoting family stabilization and long-term success

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to protecting the safety, dignity, and well-being of every child we serve.

04/22/2025,2574761.56,HHS-ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES,Not available,,"This message provides a comprehensive justification for the payment request associated with Grant #90ZU045003, which funds the Transitional Foster Care program for Unaccompanied Alien Children, supported by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

The total reimbursement amount requested is $2,574,761.56, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU045003 supports a Transitional Foster Care program, a short-term, temporary foster care model designed to provide safe, family-based placements for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). These children are placed in licensed foster homes while approved sponsors are located and vetted. The goal is to provide temporary, trauma-informed care in a nurturing environment while facilitating timely reunification with family members or other approved sponsors.

This program operates across Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Nevada, and South Carolina, with a combined licensed bed capacity of 480. While in care, children receive medical, mental health, educational, and case management services in alignment with ORR standards. Case managers also ensure children are informed of and attend their scheduled immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear), as required under federal immigration procedures.

The structure and delivery of these services not only support ORR’s care and custody goals but also serve as a frontline defense against trafficking and exploitation. By maintaining consistent oversight, family-based placements, and structured reunification planning, this program plays a critical role in reducing the risk of trafficking among unaccompanied alien children—a population particularly vulnerable during transitional periods.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $1,874,770.15
Supports direct care staff including clinicians, case managers, youth care workers, and program supervisors responsible for the daily care, supervision, and reunification planning of children in temporary foster placements.

Fringe – $251,050.83
Covers employer-paid benefits such as payroll taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions for staff directly engaged in program delivery.

Supplies – $30,014.18
Includes hygiene kits, school supplies, clothing, bedding, and other essential personal care items to meet the immediate needs of children in temporary care.

Other – $235,741.21
Includes foster parent per diems, which are daily payments made to licensed foster families who provide short-term care for unaccompanied alien children. This line also includes interpretation services and other essential non-categorized program-related expenses.

Travel – $7,445.34
Covers transportation costs associated with safe and timely unification of children with their approved sponsors, a key function of the transitional foster care model.

Administrative/Indirect – $175,739.85
Supports infrastructure, compliance monitoring, IT systems, and other indirect costs necessary to operate a federally funded program across multiple sites.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses included in this payment request are reasonable, necessary, and appropriate for the continued operation of this federally funded transitional foster care program. The costs support essential program functions, including temporary placements, sponsor reunification, and case management services that ensure children remain in safe, supervised environments.

This program not only fulfills immediate care obligations but also actively reduces the risk of trafficking and exploitation by preventing the release of children into unsafe conditions and ensuring court compliance and coordinated service delivery.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Transitional Foster Care program, are implemented in accordance with federal guidelines and align with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Providing care and protection for vulnerable unaccompanied alien children
	•	Facilitating safe and appropriate family reunification
	•	Preventing exploitation and trafficking of children
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes through oversight, coordination, and service delivery

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to accountability, compliance, and excellence in our service to unaccompanied alien children.

These staff members are located throughout the United States in order to best support the needs and mission of the Administration for Children and Families. These funds are to pay payroll and related fringe for the period of 4-28-2025 to 5-11-2025.

Staff are compensated in accordance with the U.S. Department of Labor McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA). Because these staff members work and reside in different states with different compensation requirements and thresholds, each is paid the prevailing wage determination based on where they are performing their duties. These staff members consist of the following positions as approved and appropriated by the grant:

Direct Care staff, Case Managers, Case Aides, Intake staff, Administrative Assistants, Personnel Resources support staff, Regional support staff, Training staff, Site directors and supervisors, compliance and analytical staff, and logistics staff.

Total requested is as follows:
Personnel: Salaries and Wages - $1,638,327.93
Fringe: Payroll Taxes - $123,934.31
Fringe: State Unemployment - $3,595.31
Fringe: Worker’s Compensation Insurance - $18,789.81
Fringe: Retirement Expense - $56,115.45
Indirect Expense (15%) - $276,114.42

President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have affirmatively stated that the federal government will not be complicit in the tacit trafficking of unaccompanied alien children –who are extraordinarily vulnerable to exploitation – by failing to require proven connections between adult sponsors and children and failing to conduct thorough safety assessments prior to and following placement into a home. The positions stated above are necessary to fulfill this mission and have been appropriated under the terms of the grant. This work includes intake, home visitation, interviewing, reunification recommendation, services planning, and significant incident reporting on an individual basis for each child.

1. Salaries and Benefits:
The allocation for salaries and benefits is critical to ensure that we can retain qualified educators and staff who provide high-quality instruction and support to our children and families. This funding will cover the salaries of teachers, support staff, and management staff, along with necessary benefits such as health insurance and retirement contributions. By investing in our personnel, we enhance student learning outcomes and program morale.
2. Substitute Teachers:
Funding for substitute teachers is essential to maintain instructional continuity when regular teachers are absent due to illness, professional development, or personal matters. This line item ensures that students receive uninterrupted instruction, allowing for consistent learning experiences. It also supports the wellbeing of our teachers by enabling them to take necessary leave without compromising student education.
3. Classroom Supplies:
Classroom supplies are vital for creating an engaging and effective learning environment. This budget line will cover essential materials such as crayons, easel paper, primary pencils, newsprint paper, and other educational resources that facilitate hands-on learning and support diverse instructional strategies. Investing in classroom supplies directly impacts student engagement and academic success.
4. Health Supplies:
The allocation for health supplies is crucial for maintaining a safe and healthy school environment. This includes items such as first aid kits supplies, gloves, pull-ups, cleaning supplies, and other health resource materials that help mitigate the spread of illness among students and staff. By prioritizing health supplies, we demonstrate our commitment to the well-being of our school community, which is especially important in light of recent health concerns.
5. Vision Screener:
Investing in a vision screener is necessary to ensure that all students receive early detection and intervention for vision issues that may hinder their academic performance. By providing this essential health screening, we can identify students who may need further evaluation and support, ultimately contributing to their overall success and well-being.
6. Technology Supplies for Printer Ink:
Funding for printer ink is essential to support the administrative needs of both classrooms and offices. This allows for the printing of instructional materials, student assessments, and important communications to parents and the community. Having reliable access to printed materials enhances our ability to deliver effective instruction and maintain efficient operations.
In summary, each line item in this budget is designed to support the educational mission of our program, ensuring that we have the necessary resources to provide a high-quality learning environment for all students. Thank you for considering this justification for our budget request.

04/22/2025,1257355.11,HHS-ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES,Not available,,"This message provides a comprehensive justification for the payment request associated with Grant #90ZU050802, which funds the Transitional Foster Care program for Unaccompanied Alien Children, supported by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

The total reimbursement amount requested is $1,257,355.11, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU050802 supports a Transitional Foster Care program, a short-term, temporary foster care model designed to provide safe, family-based placements for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). These children are placed in licensed foster homes while approved sponsors are located and vetted. The goal is to provide temporary, trauma-informed care in a nurturing environment while facilitating timely reunification with family members or other approved sponsors.

This program operates across Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, and South Carolina, with a combined licensed bed capacity of 252. While in care, children receive medical, mental health, educational, and case management services in alignment with ORR standards. Case managers also ensure children are informed of and attend their scheduled immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear), as required under federal immigration procedures.

The structure and delivery of these services not only support ORR’s care and custody goals but also serve as a frontline defense against trafficking and exploitation. By maintaining consistent oversight, family-based placements, and structured reunification planning, this program plays a critical role in reducing the risk of trafficking among unaccompanied alien children—a population particularly vulnerable during transitional periods.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $886,524.57
Supports direct care staff including clinicians, case managers, youth care workers, and program supervisors responsible for the daily care, supervision, and reunification planning of children in temporary foster placements.

Fringe – $127,260.76
Covers employer-paid benefits such as payroll taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions for staff directly engaged in program delivery.

Supplies – $10,098.38
Includes hygiene kits, school supplies, clothing, bedding, and other essential personal care items to meet the immediate needs of children in temporary care.

Other – $139,199.80
Includes foster parent per diems, which are daily payments made to licensed foster families who provide short-term care for unaccompanied alien children. This line also includes interpretation services and other essential non-categorized program-related expenses.

Travel – $1,552.75
Covers transportation costs associated with safe and timely unification of children with their approved sponsors, a key function of the transitional foster care model.

Administrative/Indirect – $92,718.85
Supports infrastructure, compliance monitoring, IT systems, and other indirect costs necessary to operate a federally funded program across multiple sites.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses included in this payment request are reasonable, necessary, and appropriate for the continued operation of this federally funded transitional foster care program. The costs support essential program functions, including temporary placements, sponsor reunification, and case management services that ensure children remain in safe, supervised environments.

This program not only fulfills immediate care obligations but also actively reduces the risk of trafficking and exploitation by preventing the release of children into unsafe conditions and ensuring court compliance and coordinated service delivery.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Transitional Foster Care program, are implemented in accordance with federal guidelines and align with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Providing care and protection for vulnerable unaccompanied alien children
	•	Facilitating safe and appropriate family reunification
	•	Preventing exploitation and trafficking of children
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes through oversight, coordination, and service delivery

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to accountability, compliance, and excellence in our service to unaccompanied alien children.

04/22/2025,977283.92,HHS-ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES,Not available,,"This message provides a comprehensive justification for the payment request associated with Grant #90ZU049803, which funds the Transitional Foster Care program for Unaccompanied Alien Children, supported by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

The total reimbursement amount requested is $977,283.92, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU049803 supports a Transitional Foster Care program, a short-term, temporary foster care model designed to provide safe, family-based placements for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). These children are placed in licensed foster homes while approved sponsors are located and vetted. The goal is to provide temporary, trauma-informed care in a nurturing environment while facilitating timely reunification with family members or other approved sponsors.

This program operates across Colorado, Virginia, and Wisconsin, with a combined licensed bed capacity of 90. While in care, children receive medical, mental health, educational, and case management services in alignment with ORR standards. Case managers also ensure children are informed of and attend their scheduled immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear), as required under federal immigration procedures.

The structure and delivery of these services not only support ORR’s care and custody goals but also serve as a frontline defense against trafficking and exploitation. By maintaining consistent oversight, family-based placements, and structured reunification planning, this program plays a critical role in reducing the risk of trafficking among unaccompanied alien children—a population particularly vulnerable during transitional periods.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $563,635.06
Supports direct care staff including clinicians, case managers, youth care workers, and program supervisors responsible for the daily care, supervision, and reunification planning of children in temporary foster placements.

Fringe – $137,252.68
Covers employer-paid benefits such as payroll taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions for staff directly engaged in program delivery.

Supplies – $32,491.06
Includes hygiene kits, school supplies, clothing, bedding, and other essential personal care items to meet the immediate needs of children in temporary care.

Other – $153,926.85
Includes foster parent per diems, which are daily payments made to licensed foster families who provide short-term care for unaccompanied alien children. This line also includes interpretation services and other essential non-categorized program-related expenses.

Travel – $1,234.56
Covers transportation costs associated with safe and timely unification of children with their approved sponsors, a key function of the transitional foster care model.

Administrative/Indirect – $88,743.71
Supports infrastructure, compliance monitoring, IT systems, and other indirect costs necessary to operate a federally funded program across multiple sites.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses included in this payment request are reasonable, necessary, and appropriate for the continued operation of this federally funded transitional foster care program. The costs support essential program functions, including temporary placements, sponsor reunification, and case management services that ensure children remain in safe, supervised environments.

This program not only fulfills immediate care obligations but also actively reduces the risk of trafficking and exploitation by preventing the release of children into unsafe conditions and ensuring court compliance and coordinated service delivery.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Transitional Foster Care program, are implemented in accordance with federal guidelines and align with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Providing care and protection for vulnerable unaccompanied alien children
	•	Facilitating safe and appropriate family reunification
	•	Preventing exploitation and trafficking of children
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes through oversight, coordination, and service delivery

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to accountability, compliance, and excellence in our service to unaccompanied alien children.

The program prevents prolonged institutionalization and offers immediate stability through temporary placements, with children typically remaining in care for 30 to 90 days.

This program operates across three offices in Georgia, Illinois, and Indiana, supporting a combined bed capacity of 168. While in care, children receive trauma-informed support services including medical, mental health, education, and case management. Importantly, case managers ensure children are aware of and attend their scheduled immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear) as required under federal immigration procedures.

04/22/2025,564967.94,HHS-ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES,Not available,,"This message provides a detailed justification for the payment request associated with Grant #90ZU060902, which funds the Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC) program for Unaccompanied Alien Children, supported by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

The total reimbursement amount requested is $564,967.94, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU060902 supports a Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC) program, a specialized foster care model designed for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) who are not currently eligible for short-term reunification due to the absence of a viable sponsor. These children remain in licensed foster homes for extended periods while pursuing immigration relief or permanency planning options. The program offers trauma-informed support, long-term stability, and a nurturing family environment to promote healing and growth.

Children in this program receive educational services, medical and mental health care, and ongoing case management. Case managers ensure that all children attend their required immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear) and that legal and permanency planning is actively maintained in compliance with ORR guidelines.

Even though the children in this program currently lack viable sponsors, our staff continues to actively search for and vet potential sponsors throughout the child’s placement, consistent with ORR’s commitment to family reunification when safe and appropriate.

The Long-Term Foster Care model is essential for children who are especially vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. The structure of the program—including stable placements, adult supervision, and rigorous oversight—provides a critical safety net, ensuring these children are not released into unsafe or uncertain circumstances.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $310,565.36
Supports case managers, clinicians, and other licensed professionals responsible for long-term care delivery, legal compliance, and permanency planning.

Fringe – $85,689.72
Includes employer-paid benefits such as health insurance, payroll taxes, and retirement contributions for LTFC program staff.

Supplies – $4,106.14
Covers hygiene items, clothing, school supplies, and other essentials needed for day-to-day care of children in long-term placements.

Other – $116,491.61
Includes foster parent per diems for licensed families providing extended care, as well as interpretation and other necessary non-categorized program services.

Travel – $0.00
No travel-related costs were incurred during this period.

Administrative/Indirect – $48,115.11
Covers infrastructure, compliance monitoring, IT, and general administrative support needed to operate the program effectively.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses listed are reasonable, necessary, and appropriate for the continued operation of a federally funded Long-Term Foster Care program. These costs reflect the program’s commitment to child safety, legal compliance, long-term care coordination, and sponsor identification efforts. By maintaining stable placements and consistent case management, the program prevents unnecessary transfers, protects children from trafficking risks, and provides a path toward permanency.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Long-Term Foster Care program, are implemented in accordance with federal requirements and are aligned with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Providing care and protection for unaccompanied alien children who lack viable sponsors
	•	Preventing exploitation and trafficking through structured long-term care and supervision
	•	Ensuring full immigration court compliance and legal follow-up
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes while actively pursuing reunification opportunities

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to delivering high-quality, compliant care for vulnerable children who require long-term support.","The expenses described are consistent with the purpose of the National Youth Advocate Program, Inc. program.

1. Our bimonthly payroll for a little over 150 employees (serving over 600 children and families) averages $265,000 for a cash requirement. This amount is due on 5/10/2025
2. Our indirect payment to the company that handles the administration burden is $74,313 a month. The total fee is less than 10% of our whole grant. The amount was due on 5/1/2025
3. Our 401k payments come separately from the payroll run. This averages about $8,500 a payroll run, also due on 5/10/2025
4. The medical insurance bill for United is on average $63,000 for coverage on some of our employees. This is also due on 5/10/2025
5. We have a range of automatic ACH payments that hit our account in the first few days of the month. As of today, we have a total of $12,356.42, however, I was only requesting $10,000 to cover this. The ACH payments include for all 5 campuses: Phone, Internet, Security, Utilities, and Insurance.
6. We operate our accounts payable through a system called Airbase - this requires 2 approvers before anything can get paid. The current amount sitting in the approved queue waiting to be paid is $180,000. All of these items are due as of now(5/7/2025) and include items such as: Cleaning and supplies for campuses, Classroom supplies, including diapers, meals for children (most gets covered by state, but a portion is still remaining), some repair cost to have a working AC at one of our campuses, lawncare for our campuses, and some contractors for child behavor specialist and medical nurses.
7. Also, in the Airbase system, we have to prepay the credit cards. We like to keep $10,000 in there for incidentals.
The total for these expenses is a little over $610,000. (We round numbers down to prevent overspending of our grant, and we keep round numbers when requesting to prevent odd amounts from getting stuck in the system - we once were held up for weeks because of math errors in both of these in the Payment Management System)
Our spreadsheet also lists a $50,000 bank reserve we are required to have per our policies and procedures. This is for emergencies and is based on holding about $10,000 per campus for incidentals.

Once March is closed (roughly 04/24/25), a much smaller amount will be requested for any remaining expenses incurred during March, thus truing up March and closing.

The organization's previous Finance Director's system for determining drawdown amounts was not able to be determined. I am the new CFO for Head Start and as such, am creating a consistent method of requests. This method is as follows: 

Previous method - not determined.

Current Method - on/around mid-month a revenue/expense report will be generated showing all current expenses incurred by the Head Start program for the previous month. A request for payment will then be submitted at that time. One week later, after the previous month has been finalized and closed, a request for payment will be submitted in the amount of the balance (much smaller) of remaining expenses from the previous month.

Note - I joined this organization in February, and when analyzing expense reports, it appears the funding previously requested for February did not match the total February expenses. An addendum request for reimbursement of the balance of February's expenses will also be made to correct and true up through the end of February.

Working with the Teaching Strategies Curriculum:
 
IgniteTable by Hatch™ provides a collaborative learning experience where children engage with peers while building prosocial, communication, and cooperative learning skills. As young learners play, IgniteTable automatically captures authentic work samples and data, allowing teachers to spend less time administering assessments and more time supporting the development of essential prosocial skills that set children up for success in school and beyond. As the table captures data, it is uploaded into the Creative Curriculum assessment tool called GOLD. This enables teachers to gather more information about a child’s learning. Then teachers can use the data to individualize for each child to support their continued development and learning by planning for the next steps.

The first provider, HealthCare Access Maryland, works in partnership with the Baltimore City Health Department to reduce infant and maternal mortality through the nationally recognized initiative, B'more for Healthy Babies (BHB). HCAM operates BHB’s citywide centralized intake system for pregnant women and infants, serving as the single point of entry for: 
(1) home visiting services, (2) health insurance and nine managed care organizations, (3) obstetric and pediatric services, (4) behavioral health services, (5) nutrition services, (6) and other supports in the system.  The second provider, the Family League of Baltimore, spearheads BHB’s community engagement work, overseeing the contracts for two BHB Community Sites, designing and implementing BHB’s faith-based outreach strategy, and managing BHB’s Community Advisory Board. In addition, Family League oversees several home visiting providers in the city, and works closely with BCHD, HealthCare Access Maryland (HCAM), and Baltimore City Public Schools to place Community Health Advocates in several of the city’s community action centers.

These funds are critical and contributing to the reduction of infant mortality in the City and more efficient and effective service delivery for families with pregnant women and infants.

We certify that these costs are reasonable, necessary, allocable, and allowable under the terms of the award.

04/22/2025,260974.66,HHS-ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES,Not available,,"This message provides a detailed justification for the payment request associated with Grant #90ZU056802, which funds the Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC) program for Unaccompanied Alien Children, supported by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

The total reimbursement amount requested is $260,974.66, covering expenses incurred during the period of March 1–31, 2025.

Program Overview:
Grant #90ZU056802 supports a Long-Term Foster Care (LTFC) program, a specialized foster care model designed for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) who are not currently eligible for short-term reunification due to the absence of a viable sponsor. These children remain in licensed foster homes for extended periods while pursuing immigration relief or permanency planning options. The program provides consistent, trauma-informed support, educational services, and a stable family environment to promote healing and long-term well-being.

This LTFC program operates in Illinois, with a licensed bed capacity of 96. While in care, children receive comprehensive support including medical, mental health, education, and long-term case management services. Critically, case managers ensure children are informed of and attend all required immigration court hearings (Notice to Appear), in full compliance with federal immigration processes.

While these children do not currently have viable sponsors, our team continues to actively search for and vet potential sponsors throughout the child’s placement. These ongoing efforts reflect our commitment to reunification whenever safely and appropriately possible, in accordance with ORR’s priorities.

Children in long-term care are particularly vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation. By providing structured, licensed family-based placements and continuous oversight, this program significantly reduces the risk of trafficking, ensuring children are not released into unsafe or unstable conditions during a critical phase in their immigration journey.

Time Period Covered:
This request reflects costs incurred from March 1 to March 31, 2025.

Summary of Costs and Justification:

Salaries – $157,705.16
Supports licensed staff including case managers, clinicians, and program supervisors responsible for long-term care coordination, legal follow-up, and permanency planning.

Fringe – $42,042.47
Includes employer-paid benefits such as payroll taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions for long-term care program staff.

Supplies – $2,048.43
Covers basic necessities for long-term care placements including hygiene products, bedding, educational materials, and clothing.

Other – $21,427.33
Includes foster parent per diems paid to licensed caregivers providing long-term placements, as well as interpretation services and other essential program support costs.

Travel – $0.00
No travel expenses were incurred during this reporting period.

Administrative/Indirect – $37,751.27
Supports infrastructure, IT, compliance, and administrative oversight required to sustain a high-quality long-term foster care program.

Necessity and Reasonableness:
All expenses included in this payment request are reasonable, necessary, and appropriate to the ongoing operation of a federally funded Long-Term Foster Care program. The costs reflect the core supports necessary to care for children without immediate reunification options while continuing efforts to identify potential sponsors and prepare for permanency planning.

The program ensures that children are placed in safe, licensed homes, that their legal and developmental needs are met, and that they are protected from trafficking and unsafe discharge situations through structured care and oversight.

Alignment with Federal Priorities:
All ORR-funded programs operated by the National Youth Advocate Program, including this Long-Term Foster Care program, are implemented in accordance with federal regulations and align with the President’s Executive Orders and national priorities, including:
	•	Providing continued care and protection for unaccompanied alien children who lack viable sponsors
	•	Preventing exploitation and trafficking through long-term placement and supervision
	•	Ensuring immigration court compliance and legal follow-through
	•	Supporting efficient immigration system processes while actively pursuing reunification opportunities

Please let us know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this request. We remain committed to ensuring quality care, legal compliance, and protective oversight for children in our long-term foster care program.

The grant under subaccount 02TD00013601 was awarded for the construction of the Paraiso de Amor center. The NOA relevant remark is transcribed below.

26. REMARKS

This grant action awards Hurricane Relief funds in the amount of $1,969,449 for the 7/01/2020-06/30/2022 budget period. Funds under CAN G020700 are designated to support the restoration of Head Start and/or Early Head Start services following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in accordance with Office of Head Start (OHS) Program Instruction ACF-PI-HS-18-02 (the Program Instruction).
These funds are awarded following review of a funding request (application) demonstrating that the funds awarded fall within one or more of the six categories identified in the Program Instruction and are for necessary expenses directly related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and/or Maria in areas served by Fundacion para el Hogar Propio, Inc.
CONSTRUCTION: $1,969,449
Proposed improvements to the Paraíso de Amor EHS center for the following:
•	$34,046- Engineering, geotechnical, structural, land surveying, environmental, and permits.
•	$164,514- Design Services
•	$10,000- Legal Services
•	$1,545,981-Major Renovation Costs:
- The FDHP expects to serve the assigned enrollment of twenty (20) infants and toddlers in three (3) Early Head Start environments at the renovated facility. However, it will have available space for twenty-four (24) children. This would require a redistribution of the spaces in the existing structure, and partial demolition of existing walls. The structure in whole won’t be demolished. The new design solution will allow the entrance relocation of the facility from the front (street facing) to a protected area on the left side of the building (side façade). - The front façade will be covered with vegetation to soften the urban “hardness” of the immediate context. The site accommodates six parking spaces inside the center’s facilities and 15 parking spaces in its perimeter.
- The outdoor natural playground will be located on the back patio of the existing building.
26. REMARKS (Continued from previous page)

This action extends the budget and project period to January 31, 2025, for the completion of approved activities in the amount of $1,607,565 for Paraiso de Amor Center at Las Piedras, Puerto Rico.
Funds must not be expended for any other purpose(s).
The construction is nearing completion; therefore, the fund request is intended for the payment of Certification #13.

The use of these funds is necessary to enhance the physical safety, accessibility, and overall environment of the facility to ensure a secure and developmentally appropriate setting for infants, toddlers, and their families.
The funds will be used for the following specific purposes:
•	$45,356 – Landscaping: Landscaping will address current safety hazards such as uneven terrain and poorly maintained grounds, while also creating a welcoming and developmentally appropriate outdoor environment for learning and family engagement activities. Improvements will support positive sensory experiences and meet Head Start Program Performance Standards for safe and healthy learning environments.
•	$85,996.68 – Purchase and Installation of a Security System: A comprehensive security system is necessary to safeguard the facility's children, families, and staff. The system will include surveillance cameras, access controls, and alarm systems to monitor the premises' entrances, exits, and activity. This aligns with Early Head Start’s commitment to child safety and protection, particularly considering increasing concerns around school and childcare facility security nationwide.
These facility enhancements are directly aligned with the purpose of the supplemental funds and the overall mission of the Early Head Start program—to provide a safe, nurturing, and developmentally supportive environment for low-income families with infants and toddlers. By investing in secure and well-maintained infrastructure, this project supports the long-term sustainability and quality of Early Head Start services at the SECU Hope Center.

02CH012087-04 $ 63,000.00
02TD000136-01 $103,455.00
Today, we received a communication from HHS requesting additional information: “Additional clarification required for your recent payment request from PMS.”
The grant under subaccount 02TD00013601 was awarded for the construction of the Paraiso de Amor center. The NOA relevant remark is transcribed below.

26. REMARKS

This grant action awards Hurricane Relief funds in the amount of $1,969,449 for the 7/01/2020-06/30/2022 budget period. Funds under CAN G020700 are designated to support the restoration of Head Start and/or Early Head Start services following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in accordance with Office of Head Start (OHS) Program Instruction ACF-PI-HS-18-02 (the Program Instruction).
These funds are awarded following review of a funding request (application) demonstrating that the funds awarded fall within one or more of the six categories identified in the Program Instruction and are for necessary expenses directly related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and/or Maria in areas served by Fundacion para el Hogar Propio, Inc.
CONSTRUCTION: $1,969,449
Proposed improvements to the Paraíso de Amor EHS center for the following:
•	$34,046- Engineering, geotechnical, structural, land surveying, environmental, and permits.
•	$164,514- Design Services
•	$10,000- Legal Services
•	$1,545,981-Major Renovation Costs:
- The FDHP expects to serve the assigned enrollment of twenty (20) infants and toddlers in three (3) Early Head Start environments at the renovated facility. However, it will have available space for twenty-four (24) children. This would require a redistribution of the spaces in the existing structure, and partial demolition of existing walls. The structure in whole won’t be demolished. The new design solution will allow the entrance relocation of the facility from the front (street facing) to a protected area on the left side of the building (side façade). - The front façade will be covered with vegetation to soften the urban “hardness” of the immediate context. The site accommodates six parking spaces inside the center’s facilities and 15 parking spaces in its perimeter.
- The outdoor natural playground will be located on the back patio of the existing building.
26. REMARKS (Continued from previous page)

This action extends the budget and project period to January 31, 2025, for the completion of approved activities in the amount of $1,607,565 for Paraiso de Amor Center at Las Piedras, Puerto Rico.
Funds must not be expended for any other purpose(s).
The construction is nearing completion; therefore, the fund request is intended for the payment of Certification #13.

Each agency in Region V has provided multiple trainings to benefit our state agencies.
In Wisconsin, We held our annual Poverty Matters Conference October 9-10, 2024. At this conference we held over 29 breakout sessions in the tracks of Public Health, Battling Food Insecurity, Housing Issues and a CCAP overview. In addition to the breakout sessions, we held two keynote presentations titled Newcap's (WI Community Action Agency) Journey to Transform Service Delivery Using the Whole Family Approach and The Art of Asking Better Questions; How the Right Questions Lead to More Efficient and Effective Outcomes.  During this time we have provided multiple virtual trainings titled: Increase Your Organizations Financial Health & Sustainability, Tackling Today’s HR and Compensation Trends with Tomorrow’s Solutions, Utilizing the WI Partnership Program’s Community Impact Grant to Improve Health and Health Equity through Housing Rehabilitation, and WISCAP Virtual Advocacy Roundtable – Local Government Advocacy. We also planned and worked to provide an OMB Uniform Guidance Training presented by Wifpli in April 2025 and an Organizational Standards Training by the National Community Action Partnership.
In Illinois during this reporting period, IACAA advanced Region V’s goal of increasing local Community Action Agency capacity to implement proven family service delivery models. We launched our new online Learning Management System (LMS) and website resource library, enrolling all Illinois agencies to support onboarding, board training, and required annual training. These tools have enabled broader access to promising practices and best-in-class resources.
We began piloting a Whole Family cohort with three participating agencies committed to shifting toward family-centered coaching models. This hands-on effort is building practical capacity for 2-Gen approaches among local agencies.
We actively contributed to Region V’s shared communication strategy through the Region V, marketing of trainings, and peer information exchanges. We also maintained ongoing collaboration with state partners to avoid duplication of efforts and promote cross-agency learning.
In Indiana they have a CSBG supported contract with the CSBG contract managers that supports a series of roundtable discussions with elements of training included. The plan is based upon the training needs expressed by CAAs within the planning documents they submit to the state.  High on the list of training topics is AI, changes in employment law and fiscal management options.
Monthly roundtable discussions on LIHEAP and HCV delivery have high levels of participation where approaches are discussed.
Weekly conversations with CAA directors on issues that sometimes include service delivery models. Obstacles to effective service delivery are frequently a discussion topic.
In Michigan, they developed a Training and Technical Assistance plan for 2024-2025. The plan was developed based on the training needs survey and with input from the state CSBG office the Bureau of Community Action and Economic Opportunity (BCAEO). MCA met with staff from BCAEO to review the plan and will continue to meet to update or review the plan.
MCA's leadership programs are in process including Leadership Development Institute and Emerging Leaders. Additional trainings offered to the member network include Introduction to ROMA and Fund Development. Planning is underway for the 2025 Summer conference which will include specific sessions on topics identified in the training needs assessment and from the state CSBG office.
In Minnesota, they Continued enhancement and increased leadership development through facilitating a leadership institute and CCAP study groups.

2.	End the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage
3.	Prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies
4.	Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families
The funds being requested are to reimburse funds spent for cash assistance to families who are eligible for Nebraska’s Aid to Dependent Children cash assistance program, the Employment First program, Nebraska’s welfare to work program and all community based programs that are currently contracted to provide services that meet one of the other purposes of TANF. These programs include child care costs, child welfare programs, home visiting, The Healthy Fatherhood Initiative, Child Advocacy Centers and others that have been approved by ACF through Nebraska’s state plan. In addition to the programs and services, funds will also be utilized for the administration of the program and system updates to ensure that the programs are able to continue. 
These programs are necessary to continue working with families to increase self-sufficiency through employment and training opportunities to move participants to employment opportunities, address concerns that are preventing their family from a two parent family, and focusing on keeping families together. Each program offered in Nebraska is focused on working with families to provide education and opportunities that will assist them in understanding the importance of employment, family and reducing generational poverty for their family.
