FORMAL REFERRAL FOR INVESTIGATION
Suspected Medicaid Fraud — Ambassador Health Services Network
================================================================================

Date: February 14, 2026

To: Florida Attorney General — Medicaid Fraud Control Unit
    Office of the Attorney General, PL-01 The Capitol, Tallahassee, FL 32399-1050
    Phone: (850) 414-3990

RE: Referral for Investigation of Suspected Medicaid Fraud
    Subject: Ambassador Health Services / Ambassador Home Health Services
    State: Florida
    Aggregate Medicaid Payments: $197,303,295.52
    Number of Provider Entities (NPIs): 9
    Applicable Law: 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(q); Fla. Stat. § 409.920 (Florida False Claims Act)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This referral presents data-driven evidence of potential Medicaid billing fraud
by a network of 9 provider entities operating under the
"Ambassador Health Services" and "Ambassador Home Health Services" brand names
across 9 cities in Florida.

These entities have collectively billed Florida Medicaid $197,303,295.52
(approximately $197.3 million). Statistical analysis
of publicly available Medicaid provider spending data reveals that every
Ambassador entity exhibits multiple fraud indicators that substantially deviate
from peer provider norms.

The pattern of multiple separate NPIs under a common brand, combined with
extreme billing metrics and minimal service code diversity, is consistent with
a coordinated billing scheme designed to maximize payments while avoiding
per-entity audit thresholds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. HCPCS CODES BILLED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ambassador entities predominantly bill the following home health nursing
codes. Claim-level sample data confirms S9124 usage; the extremely low code
diversity (6 of 9 entities bill only 1-2 codes) suggests near-exclusive
reliance on these codes:

  - S9124: Nursing care, in the home; by registered nurse, per hour (Home Health Nursing)
    Status: Confirmed via claim-level data for NPIs 1124261284, 1023477940
  - S9123: Nursing care, in the home; by licensed practical nurse, per hour (Home Health Nursing)
    Status: Probable — same service category, LPN-level variant of S9124.
  - S9122: Home health aide or certified nursing assistant, in the home; per hour (Home Health Aide)
    Status: Probable — same service category, aide-level variant.

For context, S9124 is the single highest-spending HCPCS code in Palm Beach
County at $187.97 million across all providers. Ambassador entities billing
this code at $531.06 per claim is
significantly above the population average.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. STATISTICAL FRAUD INDICATORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following statistical signals were computed by comparing each Ambassador
entity against all 3-code
providers in the dataset. Thresholds are set at the 95th percentile — meaning
only the top 5% of providers would normally trigger each flag.

Flag Summary (entities triggering / total entities):

  - Cost per claim exceeds 95th percentile of all providers: 8 of 9 entities
  - Cost per beneficiary exceeds 95th percentile: 9 of 9 entities
  - Claims per beneficiary exceeds 95th percentile: 9 of 9 entities
  - Billing only 1-2 HCPCS codes (low service diversity): 6 of 9 entities

Key peer benchmarks used:
  - Median cost per claim (all providers):       $34.97
  - 95th percentile cost per claim:              $173.03
  - Ambassador average cost per claim:           $531.06

  - Median cost per beneficiary (all providers): $49.56
  - 95th percentile cost per beneficiary:        $893.21
  - Ambassador average cost per beneficiary:     $10,604.65

  - Median claims per beneficiary:               1.3
  - 95th percentile claims per beneficiary:      9.6
  - Ambassador average claims per beneficiary:   19.5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. RED FLAGS — DETAILED FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. NETWORK STRUCTURE: 9 separate NPIs billing under the Ambassador brand across 9 Florida cities, totalling $197,303,295.52 in Medicaid payments. This is consistent with a franchise or shell-company network designed to stay below per-entity audit thresholds.

  2. EXTREME COST PER BENEFICIARY: 9 of 9 Ambassador entities exceed the 95th-percentile cost-per-beneficiary (>$893.21). Worst offender: AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC in ORLANDO at $15,784.12/beneficiary — 318.5x the median provider.

  3. HIGH COST PER CLAIM: 8 of 9 entities exceed the 95th-percentile cost-per-claim (>$173.03).

  4. LOW SERVICE DIVERSITY: 6 of 9 entities bill only 1-2 HCPCS codes (median provider uses 3). This is a classic indicator of upcoding or phantom billing. Details: AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC (TALLAHASSEE): 1 codes, AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC (FORT MYERS): 1 codes, AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC (ORLANDO): 2 codes, AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC (DELRAY BEACH): 2 codes, AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES, INC. (SPRING HILL): 2 codes, AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC (PALM HARBOR): 2 codes

  5. EXCESSIVE UTILIZATION: 9 of 9 entities have claims-per-beneficiary above the 95th percentile (9.6). This may indicate billing for services not actually rendered.

  6. GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION: Ambassador operates in 9 cities across Florida. Average cost/claim=$531.06 with CV=0.32. A coordinated billing scheme would show consistent pricing patterns across locations.

  7. TAMPA ANOMALY: The Tampa location (NPI 1922467844) has dramatically different billing patterns: cost/claim=$119.38 vs $582.52 average for other Ambassador locations, and 8,788 beneficiaries (much higher). This may represent a legitimate operation or a different billing strategy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. DATA SOURCES AND METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Source:
  - HHS Medicaid Provider Spending data released via the Department of
    Government Efficiency (DOGE) at stopendataprod.blob.core.windows.net
  - Full dataset: approximately 227 million rows, 10.3 GB
  - Provider names resolved via CMS NPPES NPI Registry (npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov)
  - Coverage period: 2018-01 through 2024-12 (84 months)

Methodology:
  - All providers in the dataset were ranked by total Medicaid payments
  - Per-unit metrics (cost/claim, cost/beneficiary, claims/beneficiary) were
    computed for each provider
  - Fraud signal flags were set at the 95th percentile of each metric
  - Low code diversity flagged when a provider bills 2 or fewer HCPCS codes
  - Ambassador entities were identified by provider name matching and
    cross-referenced across all NPI registrations in Florida

Limitations:
  - This analysis is based on aggregated billing data, not individual claim
    records. The specific services rendered cannot be verified from this data.
  - The HCPCS codes billed by each Ambassador entity are confirmed for 2 NPIs
    via a sample; the remaining 7 are inferred from billing patterns.
  - This referral identifies statistical anomalies. Determination of fraud
    requires access to medical records, patient interviews, and on-site review.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. REQUESTED ACTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the findings above, we respectfully request:

  1. INVESTIGATION: Formal investigation into the billing practices of all
     9 Ambassador-branded entities listed in Section 2.

  2. MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW: Verification that claimed home nursing visits
     (S9124/S9123/S9122) correspond to actual services rendered to actual
     patients, particularly for entities with extreme claims-per-beneficiary
     ratios (19-23 claims per beneficiary vs. population median of
     1.3).

  3. PATIENT VERIFICATION: Confirmation that the 24,685
     unique beneficiaries billed across Ambassador entities are real patients
     who received the claimed services.

  4. CORPORATE STRUCTURE REVIEW: Investigation of the ownership and management
     relationships between the 9 Ambassador NPIs to determine whether they
     operate as a coordinated network.

  5. PAYMENT SUSPENSION: Consideration of interim payment suspension per
     42 C.F.R. § 455.23 pending investigation, given the credible evidence
     of fraud presented herein.
