    "NETWORK STRUCTURE: 9 separate NPIs billing under the Ambassador brand across 9 Florida cities, totalling $197,303,295.52 in Medicaid payments. This is consistent with a franchise or shell-company network designed to stay below per-entity audit thresholds.",
    "EXTREME COST PER BENEFICIARY: 9 of 9 Ambassador entities exceed the 95th-percentile cost-per-beneficiary (>$893.21). Worst offender: AMBASSADOR HEALTH SERVICES INC in ORLANDO at $15,784.12/beneficiary \u2014 318.5x the median provider.",
