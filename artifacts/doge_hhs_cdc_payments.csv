The Immunization funding is crucial for the state of New Mexico as the funds are used for vaccine preventable disease efforts.Under this funding source services from the contracted mobile vaccine team occurred, messaging from the community based organizations, operating supplies, medical supplies, temporary contracted staff for IIS, VFC efforts, marketing campaign for vaccine catch up, to include measles outbreak campaign messaging. 
This funding is from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control for Immunization and Vaccines for Children that supports vaccine preventable disease activities through staffing, contractual services, and supplies for maintaining vaccine distribution to all children and underserved adult populations. The Immunization Program has 400 providers enrolled for distribution of vaccine to children and adults statewide to include underserved populations that are uninsured/underinsured and have limited acces to healthcare. It is necessary to provide these services as not adequately immunizing the population in the state may result in breakthrough disease, morbidity, and mortality. By increasing access to immunizations, vaccine preventable diseases will decrease thus reducing the burden on the Health Care system. Immunizations have been shown to positively affect population health outcomes and reduce disease burden.

Contract Coordinator developed, monitored, and managed four partner contracts and evaluation activities. Ensured fiscal and programmatic compliance with contracted partners. Served as a liaison with CDC program officers, evaluators, and contractors and managed performance measure reporting and invoices.  Health Education Coordinator assessed CHW needs for health education and advanced training; planned, implemented and evaluated Heart Health, Kidney Awareness, and Human Trafficking health education programs and promotions for the training programs; established community partnerships with Berkeley, Dellwood an Ferguson to collaborate on health issues and initiatives; and facilitated the HSYACHW curriculum. Community Health Workers served as liaisons between health department programs (e.g, public health nursing, clinical, behavioral health, healthy homes, corrections medicine) and community social services to facilitate health education and access. CHWs assessed over 64 residents in March, educated clients in individual and group settings, made referrals to address social determinants of health, and integrated CHWS in the clinic setting.
Fringe: Covers fringe cost (Social Security; Medicare Tax; Pension; Health Insurance; Dental/Vision/Life Insurance; Worker's Compensation Insurance) for the month of March in the amount of $15,837.20 for eight employees.

Contracts:  Covers three partner contracts from September 2024 – March 2025 including Beyond Housing provided client referrals, conducted CHW integration in non-traditional settings, and piloted new CHW-supporting infrastructure ($197,431.32); Saint Louis Integrated Health Network staff collaborated with the CHW Coalition and Health Literacy Media to complete video series - Video #1 focuses on role of CHW; Video #2 focuses on ROI/community health benefit of the CHW workforce and discusses sustainability options. Video #3 focuses on highlighting ways CHW employers can support the workforce.  During NCE IHN was working with Coalition and CHWs to disseminate the videos in addition to trainings to support CHW development. As a part of the CHW Common Data Platform, the IHN built out a searchable database of service providers that CHWs can utilize to make referrals for the health and social needs of their clients. The CHWs can also track the outcome of these referrals.  This referral database and tracking system is being used by 3 teams of CHWs. There are currently 260 health social service providers in the database.  IHN was beginning to work with the UMSL team to see if it is feasible to connect the CHW Common Platform to the database of service providers held by the state’s 211 system. This would allow a more comprehensive set of providers to be accessed by the CHWs. IHN staff was working with the Transition Clinic Network (TCN) to establish 1 or more transition clinics at health clinics in the St. Louis region to serve patients who have recently left jail or prison. This model centers around CHWs being integrated into clinic care teams to provide holistic support to re-entry patients ($385,575.73); and University of Missouri-St. Louis supported the evaluation and data collection for performance measurement reporting. Group Concept Mapping (GCM) evaluation approach was used for the St. Louis Community Health Worker Coalition to develop an Employer Toolkit that includes relevant standards, workforce metrics, best practices, essential resources, a policy agenda, and CHW pathways. UMSL was completing the employer Toolkit Evaluation to assess the Employer toolkit value and relevance to applied practice as well as employer's interest in sustaining this resource long-term. The Employer Survey would have been readministered in April to analyze trends and changes against baseline (after Employer Toolkit Review), and completing the GCM Discussion Guide. They were also helping with the High School and Young Adult Community Health Worker Training Program evaluation ($564,727.35) for total of $1,147,734.40.

Please note this response applies to multiple payment requests, as indirect is a standard payment request.

The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation.

Re: Request to use funds realized from Foreign Exchange gains – Award NU2GGH002484-01-00
With reference to the above subject, we write to request for the use of gains in the amount of $ 529,757.03 (Dollars Five Hundred and Twenty-Nine Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Seven and Three only) realized from ADVANCE Project for the period October to March 2025.
The funds will be used to support project beneficiaries based on the planned activities at the DREAMS and Wellness Centers
1. Procurement of supplies for the following program activities,
 School Based HIV Prevention Initiative to support the vulnerable adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in school and reduce their risk of HIV acquisition. The support includes school supplies to keep the AGYW in school such as Bags, books, pens, Pencils, Shoes and Uniforms.
 Procurement of power backup equipment for the Ciheb offices in Choma and Livingstone, as well as for five DREAMS centers, this is essential to ensure uninterrupted real-time data entry into the program data management system. This will mitigate disruptions caused by electricity outages, thereby enhancing data accuracy, timeliness, and overall program efficiency and Wellness center furniture in the psychosocial counseling rooms to De-medicalize the service delivery rooms.
 Printing of demand generation materials for the wellness centers including viral load literacy tabletop job aids.
 Air conditioners for the wellness centers located in Chirundu, a district known for its high temperatures, a necessity to ensure that sessions are conducted in a comfortable and conducive environment. This will enhance client experience, improve staff productivity, and support the overall effectiveness of wellness services.
 Others supplies such as laptop bags, Social Network Testing Strategy (SNS) incentives and Hygiene packs, Starlink modems for regional offices, and tyres for the fleet of vehicles.
2. Other Direct costs towards the payment will cover,
 Integrated campaigns (Viral load, KYCHS+, HIV case finding and Welcome back to care). Costs to cover allowances for staff and Fuel.
 Trainings for social network testing strategy (SNS) involving 75 wellness center staff, to enhance HIV case identification.
 Meetings for caring for the Carers (Mentors) involving 170 mentors, The Caring
for the Carers meetings aim to support the mental well-being of 170 DREAMS mentors, helping prevent burnout and maintain the quality of psychosocial support provided to beneficiaries. These sessions are crucial for sustaining mentor motivation and ensuring effective program delivery.
 Community Health Workers and professional counselors will conduct an integrated campaign in the first 2 weeks focused on viral load monitoring, KYCHS+, HIV case finding, and welcoming clients back to care at the 18 supported wellness centers. The additional CHWs and professional counselors will also support the sustainability of gains made during the campaigns. This initiative aims to reduce the peer-to-client ratio in service delivery and provide more person-centered care to the targeted population.
 Professional counsellors to provide supervision to Community Health Workers to ensure quality HTS and counselling is provided in the community,
 Local Transport to support community client tracing for index testing, missed appointments and for community viral load sample collection.
To support our request for the use of the gains, we have attached a detailed budget with narratives.
We thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

Major allocations focus on strengthening lab quality systems, data management, and certification support
What the award is for, what the funds will be used for, and why it is necessary
What is the award for?
The award aims to increase access to quality-assured conventional services, including HIV rapid testing, EID, detection of HIV-associated TB, and HIV VL monitoring, in order to attain and sustain optimal coverage and access to the uninterrupted laboratory and diagnostic services necessary for reaching epidemic control and making measurable progress toward UNAIDS 95-95-95.  The award also aims to increase the utilization of Quality Management Systems (QMS) and tools such as External Quality Assessment (EQA), the WHO-AFRO SLIPTA and Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) Programs, Rapid Test Quality Continuous Improvement (RTCQI), and other Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) activities leading to increased accuracy, reliability, and use of diagnostic test results, which will in turn lead to enhanced uptake for clinical decision-making and improved clinical outcomes for patients with HIV and HIV/AIDS related infections as well as ensure every individual seeking HIV testing in the PEPFAR DRC supported provinces receives an accurate result. A strengthened organizational infrastructure with a qualified laboratory workforce with the expertise to support the HIV continuum of care. 
what the funds will be used for?
The requested funds will be used to implement approaches for the adequate care and treatment of Persons Living with HIV including a novel approach for viral load scale-up. In this regard, our funding request will support the PEPFAR 5x3 strategic pillar approach, highlighting the need to ensure attention and harness resources to effectively close gaps and address inequities, supporting a person-centered and sustainable response following the science through evidence-based and data-driven programming. 
why it is necessary?
The interventions described below in our drawdown request will support accurate, reliable, and timely results, which are important for the effective care and treatment of Persons Living with HIV. The funds requested will support the following interventions:
1.	Purchase of supplies to support Data Synchronization: 
This is a site-level activity aimed at increasing viral load coverage by facilitating the availability of results of EID, IVT/VL through the purchase and installation of hardware and software for the laboratory information system in some health zones Viral Load Sample Management (VLSM) & Viral load Sample Tracking System (VLSTS) currently in use in some sites. The VLSM/VLSTS LIS ensures that once test results are available at reference labs upon testing, these results are automatically uploaded to the VLSM systems and are available for printing in the connected sites for printing and transportation to the sites that initiated the request or to clinicians for client management. VLSM/VLSTS system is active in 18 laboratories, and VLSTS active in 33 hubs. Through this activity, we want to expand the use of VLSM & VLSTS to 29 labs and 45 hubs; this will be achieved by supporting sites with the necessary IT equipment and material to support their use for returning results for patient management. 
2.	SMS result Delivery 
SMS result Delivery is to support the return of high VL/EID results to clinics, especially those with no LIS and remotely situated, to improve retention and Enhanced Adherence Counseling (EAC)  and possibly VL suppression in the long term. This intervention has already contributed to the return of more than 2592 high and unsuppressed VL results in semester 1. The SMS delivery of results also reduces the TAT for results delivery, contributing to better patient management and potentially better treatment outcomes. This model has contributed 46% to the return of high and unsuppressed VL results in the three intervention provinces within the past 6 months. 
3.	QMS training
QMS training: This is to support and guide the Implementation of Quality Management System (QMS) in the molecular and referral laboratories for accreditation and sustained quality services. Implementing ISO,15189 requirements is the ultimate goal of all diagnostics laboratories striving to establish a QMS to ensure the accuracy and reliability of patients’ test results. However, achieving ISO 15189 accreditation is challenging for most African laboratories, including the DR Congo. To facilitate the uptake of laboratory QMS in DR Congo, GHSS is executing this training on the laboratory QMS aspects to promote implementation and ensure its enforcement at all levels of the tiered laboratory network. This is essential for outbreak preparedness, especially in a country that Ebola has plagued in addition to HIV, AIDS, and other epidemics.  The QMS implementation status is evaluated using a pre-established checklist (WHO AFRO SLIPTA) through an audit. Qualified GHSS auditors do the SLIPTA audits.
4.	SLIPTA Audits
SLIPTA audits will verify the compliance of the molecular and referral laboratories performing Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) and Viral load Testing services enrolled in the Stepwise Laboratory Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) program with the medical requirements for quality and competence (ISO 15189 standards). This will also support the establishment of a national laboratory network to reinforce the strategy to strengthen services and optimize case finding among adult girls, young women, and children, which is in line with the PEPFAR COP 22 recommendations. 
5.	Data Feedback
Inadequate data and monitoring systems and gaps in the implementation of country strategic plans are programmatic gaps in attaining the UNAIDS 95-95-95 target in the DR Congo. Providing data feedback is part of a monitoring and evaluation activity to share feedback reports with sites where data is collected during on-site visits to supported sites, to follow the science behind the data, and to promote the use of data to address programmatic gaps for informed decision-making at the above-site and site levels. 
6.	Certifications
Certification provides confidence in the Point of Care Testing (POCT) results for both the user (site and tester) and the end-user (health care provider and patient). It reduces the operating costs of POCT by getting results right the first time and every time. This activity will involve the evaluation of testers and sites in the 3 supported provinces in and out of a laboratory setting using proficiency testing panels and paper-based tests to ascertain the competency of HIV test providers. The preparation of these certification panels requires supplies which will be procured. 
A certification program facilitates the implementation and maintenance of an effective quality management system; Gives confidence to users in availing the services; Gives confidence to the site and user for the results generated; Provides recognition of technical competence; Helps in defending site while dealing with legal disputes pertaining to results;  Site certification verifies that testing procedures are in place and follow, results are technically valid, only competent staff performs testing, and confirms that the site conforms to a quality management system. -Tester certification verifies that the provider performing POCT is adequately trained, is authorized to do so, and has evidence of demonstrated competency. 
7.	EQA fees 
This cost will be used to purchase and distribute External Quality Assessment (EQA) samples to ensure the accuracy and reliability of laboratory tests. By supporting EQA, we can enhance the overall quality of diagnostics, which is vital for comprehensive patient care. Accurate test results for co-infections and other health issues can lead to better management of HIV patients and their overall health
8.	Waste Disposal:
The requested cost will facilitate safe waste collection, transportation, and high-temperature incineration of used HIV 1/2 Qual Xpert test cartridges for health personnel's and the environment's safety. Guanidium Thiocyanate is the main component of the lysis buffer of the GeneXpert HIV-1 Qual and HIV-VL test cartridge at a volume of 1.4mL and 2ml respectively. More than 538 kg (10760 cartridges) of used test cartridges are in sites in the Lualaba province pending destruction through high-temperature incineration.

Funding is for Georgia CORE as coordinator of the program and for subawardees: Albany Area Primary Health Care, Augusta University, East Georgia Healthcare Center, and Horizons Community Solutions. Program activities for this quarter include:
- Wadley Clinic officially began onsite distribution of Cologuard kits in January. With two clinics now offering kits onsite, this marks a significant step forward in improving access to colorectal cancer screening for our patient populations in Southeast Georgia. Early feedback has been positive, with both staff and patients expressing appreciation for the convenience of same-day test access. This initiative directly supports our program goals of increasing screening rates and reducing barriers to preventive care. 
-CDC Documentation: The evaluation team submitted the spring annual data collection survey for 9 existing clinics and one baseline assessment. The evaluation team updated data collection tools for annual data submission.
-GCRCCP Partnership Evaluation: The evaluation team modified the Wilder Collaborative Factor Inventory to evaluate the standing of our partnership for the future. GCRCCP members completed the questionnaire in December, and results were shared with the team at the Partnership council meeting at the beginning of 2025. The evaluation team led the GCRCCP in hosting the 9th and 10th session as part of the Interactive sessions (for GCRCCP clinics only) and the 24th TeleECHO CRC Screening Project.","GMO recommends payment approval.

Under Cooperative Agreement Number GH002402 for the project titled “Strengthening Public Health Response and Accelerating HIV/AIDS Program in the City Administration of Addis Ababa (AACAHB) of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia,” funded by the PEPFAR, we are requesting funding to cover the salary and fringe benefits for project staff for April 2025.
This request is made within the framework of the approved budget for the period of September 30, 2024, to September 29, 2025 (COP 23 Year II). The funds will support employees actively engaged in various health facilities, sub-cities, and the city administration health bureau. The requested amount is exclusively for personnel currently in active roles, excluding any vacant positions.
These staff members make significant contributions across the following program areas:
•	HIV Prevention
•	HIV Case Finding
•	HIV Care and Treatment
•	Laboratory Systems Strengthening
•	Surveys, Surveillance, Research, and Evaluation (SRE)
•	Monitoring and Evaluation
•	IM Program Management

Justification for Stationery Procurement
Requested amount: $21,450.00
We procure and distribute office supplies, including stationery, to health facilities, sub-cities, and the city administration health bureau where our project activities are implemented. These materials are essential for the effective operation of both office and clinical activities, as accurate recording and documentation are critical to our work.
Therefore, we are requesting this amount to cover the costs of office supplies and stationery from the approved COP 23 Year II supplies budget category.

APPLICATION
Budget _COP23
Funding Mechanism Name:		Southern Province Health Office Zambia 
Prime Partner Name:		Southern Province Health Office (SPHO)
Grant Award Number: NU2GGH002439 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number:  CDC-RFA-GH22-2206
Budget Period: 2024 to 2025
Reason for Payment Request: Payment for the following:
DD130: Southern Provincial Health Office (SPHO) has an annual target of notifying 5,131 TB cases in FY 2025. However, in the first quarter, the Province managed to notify only 989 TB cases, falling short of the quarterly target of 1,283 cases by 294 cases. This deficit underscores the need for strengthened TB case identification and notification efforts. To address this gap, the Province has planned to send money to the 15 Districts for orientation of healthcare workers in Improved TB screening in Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) and enhanced focused TB contact tracing The oriented healthcare workers will be equipped with essential skills to: • Routinely screen HIV Recipients of Care (ROC) for TB • Conduct TB contact tracing for clients diagnosed with TB • Implement Targeted Universal TB Testing for: o Clients with Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) o Newly diagnosed HIV clients o Clients lost to follow-up o Newly diagnosed paediatric HIV cases Additionally, staff will be oriented on TB index of suspicion strategies to improve on case identification, ensuring that the Province meets its TB notification targets. This training will strengthen the capacity of frontline healthcare workers, allowing them to cascade knowledge to their peers across health facilities. PHO Team will monitor the activity in the fifteen supported Districts and give TSS
DD 130: SPHO supported districts in radio presentations on Male involvement in PMTCT as it is one of effective interventions improving uptake of ANC and PMTCT services among pregnant and breastfeeding (PBFW). The province wishes to continue supporting the districts with the funds that remained from the same activity since Male partners play important role in supporting PBFW especially those on ART. The province hopes to continue improving male involvement in MCH which has been on a lower side and affects initiation of ART when the woman is positive as she would like to seek authority from the partner before starting ART. The program is aimed at closing up knowledge gap in male involvement in MCH among community members. The radio talks will keep on sensitize the community on the importance of male involvement in ANC and early ANC booking (Starting ANC in the first trimester) as well as HIV prevention services. This platform provides an opportunity for health care workers to get views of the community on the PMTCT services since it will be a phoning program as well as clarifying of the myths and miss conception on some of the services provided in MCH.
DD136: The request to print dosing charts for the pediatric Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) of Abacavir, Lamivudine, and Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG: pALD) is essential to support accurate and standardized HIV treatment for children across health facilities in Southern Province. These charts are critical tools for healthcare providers, enabling them to quickly reference weight-based dosing guidelines and reduce the risk of under- or over-dosing in pediatric patients.
With the transition to DTG-based regimens as per national guidelines, many frontline health workers require clear, user-friendly job aids to ensure proper administration of medication in line with children’s weights and ages. The dosing charts will be used in ART clinics, pediatric wards, and pharmacy dispensing areas, directly supporting correct treatment practices and improving clinical outcomes.
The allocation of funds for printing these charts will contribute to:
• Improved accuracy in pediatric ART dosing
• Reduced medication errors
• Better adherence and viral suppression rates among children
• Strengthened capacity of healthcare workers through visual reference tools
Expected Outcomes
• Increased dosing accuracy, leading to better adherence and viral suppression rates in children.
• Reduced medication errors, minimizing risks of suboptimal treatment or adverse drug effects.
• Improved healthcare worker confidence and efficiency in managing pediatric ART patients.
• Enhanced patient outcomes, contributing to national targets for HIV control and viral load suppression.
• Ensure sustainability – Durable printed materials provide long-term reference tools, minimizing reliance on electronic systems that may not always be accessible.
The investment in these dosing charts is a cost-effective solution to support quality pediatric HIV care in Southern Province health facilities
DD138: This will involve the service and repair of Motorbikes involved in the Viral Load Courier of Samples in Districts. Motorbikes are serviced as per schedule attached in order to continue the provision of services.
DD141: SPHO CoAg receives support from CDC in HIV/TB programming and implementation across the 15 supported districts. The goal is aligned with the National Health Strategic Plan 2021-2026, which states that the goal is to reduce the HIV incidence from 28,000 in 2021 to 15,000 by 2026. The strategies are fashioned from the fast-tracked UNAIDS 95-95. The latest ZamPHIA 2021 shows a national HIV prevalence of 11% among adults aged 15+ years, with Southern Province above the national prevalence at 13.2%. The performance towards the fast-tracked UNAIDS 95- 95-95 benchmarks showed a 89-98-96 performance. SPHO is committed to providing quality PMTCT services in all 15 supported districts. The province is supporting 78 high- and medium-volume selected facilities from the 15 districts with funds for the follow-up of mother-infant pairs (MIP) who miss appointments and for the retesting of HIV PBFW. SPHO supported these facilities in FY Q2. To meet the UNAIDS 95-95-95 strategy, SPHO provides mentorship and targeted TSS activities in the 15 supported districts. This mentorship is crucial in maintaining clinical standards, improving skills, addressing knowledge gaps, and promoting positive attitudes towards patients and work

Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation. This payment request is consistent with the terms of the grant and reflects only allowable expenses in this calculation. A copy of the negotiated rate agreement is available upon request.","CDC approves the requested drawdown in line with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the HHSA Grants Policy Statement —Allowability of Costs/Activities.

Reason for payment Request: Travel and Supplies
Spending Plan: Travel:	 $35,580 and Supplies: $55,264 Total $90,845

Travel: $35,580

1.	Support selected districts in conducting mobile ART services to hard-to-reach and flood-cut-off places: $15,980. 
The funds will also be used to conduct mobile ART services in selected districts, as mobile antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs are essential for providing HIV treatment to hard-to-reach areas. The funding will help increase access to care, especially for hard-to-reach places in our rural and underserved communities, which often lack health facilities. Mobile ART units bridge this gap, bringing services directly to those in need. Mobile ART services also will reduce transportation barriers for many patients who may be unable to travel long distances to clinics due to financial, physical, or logistical challenges. Mobile ART reduces the need for travel, ensuring that individuals can receive treatment regularly. In turn, there will be improved retention in care for ROCs who will be provided with ART in their communities and are more likely to maintain their treatment regimen, reducing loss to follow-up and improving long-term health outcomes. Additionally, this service focuses on vulnerable populations, particularly those who are unable to walk to the HF, as they may face stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings due to their condition.

2.	Support WPHO in conducting an assessment of the community HRIS system and HRH site-level assessment: $15,009.
In conducting the activity, WPHO will ensure data accuracy and completeness, which will assist in assessing the iHRIS and HRH sites. This process helps verify the accuracy and completeness of HR data, which is vital for effective workforce planning, deployment, and policymaking. Additionally, the activity will improve how data is used and how decisions are made, helping to find areas where data isn't being used well, which will allow for focused training and system upgrades to support decisions based on evidence at the community and facility levels. Additionally, the activity will strengthen system integration by evaluating site-level implementation, ensuring that the iHRIS seamlessly integrates with other health information systems, thereby promoting interoperability and data sharing. The activity will also ensure that a well-assessed HR system will provide adequate staffing, which enhances service quality, patient outcomes, and community health. Lastly, the assessment will also identify challenges and opportunities, which will elucidate bottlenecks, training needs, and infrastructural gaps, guiding targeted interventions and system enhancements.

3.	Support WPHO to facilitate above-site Technical Support and Supervision and monitoring to the districts  in Infection Prevention and Control in 16 high volume sites $4,591 
The activity will improve IPC quality and compliance by providing focused technical support supervision (TSS), making sure that busy sites follow infection prevention standards, which will lower healthcare-associated infections and make patients safer. This will also provide an opportunity to address priority settings, particularly high-volume sites that are critical points of care with an increased risk of infection transmission. Regular monitoring ensures these sites maintain optimal IPC practices, which is vital for controlling disease spread, especially during outbreaks. Lastly the activity will facilitate the improvement of the Health System The activity will help make the Health System in the province stronger by improving IPC practices through supervision, which enhances the safety of health facilities and ensures they have reliable measures to protect against infections, including new and returning pathogens.

Supplies: $55,264

1.	Procuring stationery for health facilities: $47,171.
Procuring stationery for health facilities is crucial for several reasons, as essential communication, such as paper, pens, envelopes, and forms, is necessary for effective communication within the facility for patient records. It aids in the documentation of patient information, correspondence, and reporting. Patient care documentation, which includes products like patient charts and medical forms, is vital for maintaining accurate patient records on file for ROCs, which ensures continuity of care and helps healthcare providers make informed decisions. All health facilities must comply with various regulations regarding recordkeeping and documentation, making it a regulatory requirement. High-quality stationery guarantees the organization of these records and their compliance with legal standards. Furthermore, operational efficiency, which contributes to consistency, as access to stationery allows health workers to perform their duties without unnecessary delays, improves overall operational efficiency. This work is done in tandem.

2. Support repairs and servicing of project motor vehicles $8,093 
The vehicles used to monitor and supervise activities in the HFs and districts are serviced as needed. Additionally, the vehicles transport samples, commodities, and drugs from the district hubs to the HFs. Frequent servicing will prolong their life span and continuously contribute to the achievement of indicators and project goals.

The remaining funds come from other sources, we divide it up by the 12 months, at 2,916.67 monthly, we have only taken out funds once for this fiscal cycle, half of the allotted funds, we are asking for reimbursement for the remaining salary, $17,500 of the ED for this fiscal year. This grant also supports the Project Coordinators salary at 75%, the Project Coordinator's salary is $39,000 annually, so DFC pays $29,250 for the annual salary of the PC. We have used $14,625 of the allotted salary reimbursement for the PC, asking for the remaining $14,625 of the salary for the fiscal year. The last piece of salary remaining for these funds is our parttime Secretary, DFC covers 100% of her salary, she is paid $9,250 annually. We have drawn down half the funds for her salary and need to draw down the remaining $4,625.  Of the $62,500 remaining to draw down, $36,750 is for salaries of 3 staff members, leaving $25,750 remaining.

Fringe benefits are listed at 7.65% of the grant for FICA, Retirement is 6%, Insurance is 20.6%, and worker's Compensation is 1%. Cost of each annually through the DFC funds (not including seperate match) FiCA $5,623, Retirement is $4,410, Insurance is $15,141, and workers comp is $735. We have already drawn down half of these costs so $12,954.50 leaving the same amount remaining to draw down.  From the total remaining cost at $25,750 that leaves $12,795.50 left from the funds we are drawing down.

For our travel budget for the year of DFC funds we ask for $2,681 annually, already drawn down half of those funds, leaving $1340.50 left to draw down. From the total remaining above that leaves $11,455 to account for.

Office supplies for the year we ask for DFC to cover $9,900 annually, we have already used $4,950 from the first draw down, the remaining amount is $4,950. From the total previously that leaves $6,505 remaining to account for. 

Contractual request, which is CADCA's annual membership fee $300, Printer Service Fee monthly, Internet costs, Annual Website Domain Fee, and Commonwealth Prevention Alliance's annual Membership fee of $50. the total for contractual costs from this grant is $4,010. We have used $2,005 already and have a remaining $2,005 left for this fiscal year. From the total of $6,605 from above, that leaves $4500 remaining to account for. 

Next is the other category, the first ask is for $500 for a biannual event to enhance youth leadership skills in the community. We have already used $500 from this and are asking for the remaining $500. Teen Advisory Committee meetings (building our Teen Advisory Committee and utilizing youths' voices for community change) we have 4 meetings annually, at $500 per meeting. We have already drawn down $1,000 for this and have a remainining $1000 that we are asking for. That is a total of $1500 left to draw down, from the remaining $4500 that leaves $3000 to account for. 

We support the health of our youth by offering trainings, workshops, and seminars throughout the year and utilize it for at least 5 schools at $500 per school (sometimes more schools if the cost is less than $500, this year it has not been less), that is a total of $2,500. We have already drawn down $1250 to pay for this leaving a remaining draw down of $1250 from the above total we have $1850 to account for on the ask of drawing down funds. We also reduce risk and enhance protection by offering healthy alternative events throughout the year to our youth, we allot $500 per event with a goal of 5 events per fiscal year, which totals $1,250 remaining to draw down. Both of these combined equal $5000 annually, we have drawn down half of these funds already, so we have a remaining $2,500 to draw down. From the above $3000 to account for we are left with $500 to account for. 
The last piece in the other category is Sector Deveolpment where we ask for $1000 annually to provide a report out to our 200+ committee members. We have already drawn down $500 of these funds asking for the remaining $500. ","GMO recommends payment approval.

Grant Number: NU2GGH002515
Budget Period: 09/30/2024 to 09/29/2025
Reason for Payment Request: This withdrawal is designated to cover expenses associated with specific human resources for work completed in April, the acquisition of supplies (viral load tests), and the payment of part of one instalment for the renovation of the SAE (Specialized Ambulatory Service) in Fortaleza. These expenses align with the approved budget and adhere to the terms and conditions specified in the NOA.
Spend Plan:
Salaries: $ 32,820
The payment for human resources for April, to be paid on May 10th, refers to 81% of the hired personnel, and the activities of this team are directly linked to the following strategies/activities:
 
Strategy 1: Implement highly effective and evidence-based HIV prevention interventions and innovations
Activity 1.1. Expand the information and dissemination of combined prevention in Brazil
Strategy 2: Implement targeted and person-centered HIV testing approaches to reach high-risk populations
Activity 2.1. Increase access for more vulnerable groups to HIV testing through self-testing
Activity 2.2. Index Testing
Activity 2.4. HIV and STI testing and treatment
 
Strategy 3: Offer high-quality, person-centered care and treatment services
Activity 3.1. Rapid ARV Initiation and Linkage to Care
Activity 3.2. Prevention of interruption, lost to follow-up (LTFU), advanced disease, and tuberculosis
Activity 3.3. Virtual Clinic
 
Strategy 4: Promote governance, health system strengthening, strategic information, community leadership, and communication outreach to support project implementation
Activity 4.1: Strengthening the implementation of HIV prevention, diagnosis, and care in primary care services
Activity 4.4: Encourage cross-reference among HIV services and social services
 
 
Supplies: $18,750
Cartridges for rapid viral load Gene Xpert are required to achieve the outcomes from activities 3.1 and 3.2, and for the clients to start ART on the same day of diagnosis or within seven days, and for those who are reengaging in the treatment.
 
Other Category (Service): $ 6,430
This resource is necessary to pay part of the first instalment of the payment (out of a total of 4) for the renewal of the SAE in Fortaleza. Below is the justification for this hiring:
 
There has been a significant increase in demand for the health facility that we support in Fortaleza, called CTA/SAE Emanuel Gomes Pinto. Unfortunately, due to the deactivation of another SAE (Gonzaga Mota), the existing unit is unable to handle all of the demand. This has resulted in a considerable backlog of demand that needs to be addressed urgently.
 
The reason for the deactivation of SAE Gonzaga Mota was that it required a renovation that the municipality could not afford. However, this has led to a worsening of the situation at CTA/SAE Emanuel Gomes Pinto as clients began migrating there.

 Justification for the IT supplies:

1. Cloud Connexa
We need Cloud Connexa to give our teams and partners secure access to our servers from various locations. It provides strong encryption, centralized user management, and supports modern VPN protocols. This will reduce security risks and make remote access easier to manage.

2. Nessus Firewall
Implementing Nessus Firewall on our servers adds another layer of protection. It allows us to control traffic at the server level, helps stop internal threats, supports deeper traffic inspection, and meets key security standards. This will make our server environment more secure and less vulnerable to attacks.

Prime Partner Name:		Southern Province Health Office (SPHO)
Grant Award Number: NU2GGH002439 
Notice of Funding Opportunity Number:  CDC-RFA-GH22-2206
Budget Period: 2024 to 2025
Reason for Payment Request: Payment for the following:
1. Conduct Comprehensive Pediatric HIV Treatment training for Health care Workers ($27,304) - The Southern Provincial Health Office (SPHO) is seeking funding support to implement capacity-building training for Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Comprehensive Paediatric HIV Treatment. This critical intervention is aimed at equipping frontline HCWs with the essential knowledge and practical skills to deliver life-saving care and treatment services to Children and Adolescents Living with HIV (CALHIV) across the province.
The province is currently experiencing notable gaps across the Paediatric HIV cascade, including:
•	Case finding at 36% (against a target of 50%),
•	Viral load coverage (VLC) at 82% (against a target of 95%).
To close these gaps, the proposed training will cover the full spectrum of Paediatric HIV service delivery, including:
•	Case identification (target: >50%),
•	ART initiation and retention,
•	Viral load coverage and suppression (VLC target: >95%).
The training program will combine theoretical instruction with practical, hands-on experience at established Pediatric Centers of Excellence (PCOE), where HCWs will engage directly with CALHIV and experienced Paediatric HIV specialists. This blended approach is designed to ensure not only the transfer of technical knowledge but also the enhancement of clinical confidence and competencies in managing complex Paediatric HIV cases.
The funding requested will support:
•	Training logistics and coordination,
•	Development and dissemination of training materials,
•	On-site practical’s at PCOE
Expected Outcomes:
•	Increased case finding (>50%) through improved screening and testing,
•	Enhanced ART initiation and retention,
•	Improved viral load coverage (>95%) and suppression rates among CALHIV,
•	Strengthened facility-based Paediatric HIV service delivery across the province.
•	Trained HCWs in Comprehensive Paediatric ART
We appreciate your consideration and support of this initiative, which is vital to sustaining the progress made and achieving epidemic control among children and adolescents in Southern Province.

2.Procure Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision Equipment ($3,614) - Part of the supplies to be procured is for taking vital signs that ensure quality service delivery. The other part is to ensure the safety of clients during delivery service. Therefore, procuring this equipment ensures support for the delivery of high-quality, efficient, and safe services, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes and economic benefits. For sustainability of the service even when there will be limited or no external support, investing in this equipment is cardinal

3. External Audit Services ($13,333) – It is a requirement that Financial Statements of an entity are Audited by an External Audit firm.  The Audit firm will be required to issue an Audit Report at the end of the exercise to show whether the Financial Statements of our Organization show a true and Fair view. The biding process for Procurement of Audit Services was done and the successful Audit firm was selected by the Tender Committee. The External Audit will be for the Period 1st October 2023 to 30th September 2024. It is anticipated that the Audit will begin on 5th May and end by 30th May 2025. The Audit firm will be required to issue the Audit Report not later than 30th June to enable us submit to OGS before the required deadline of 30th June 2025.

Summary: Payment for services provided by ORAU to “Leverage Oak Ridge Associated Universities’ Collaborative Strengths on Behalf of CDC’s Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) National Partner Network (NPN)”. ORAU has provided ongoing contracted services this month as demonstrated by our provision of NPN Communication Bulletins, expanded resource libraries in the NPN Digital Toolkit hosted by ORAU, ready-to-use social media toolkits and materials, media monitoring, an eleven-video series educating healthcare providers about FASD, and communication technical assistance to NPN members. ORAU has contributed to a trajectory of increasing collaboration within the NPN, as demonstrated using a validated scale. The average network collaboration score has increased from 1.88 to 2.35 over the past year.

1. Other—$35,006.37: Funds will be used to support the in-service training of HIV nurse practitioners (HNPs) as they attain skills in the management of HIV ROCs. HNP training will improve patient outcomes, and investments in training HNPs enhance their clinical skills and knowledge, leading to better patient care and improved health outcomes for individuals living with HIV. The HNP training will also address workforce shortages. Considering the growing demand for HIV management, enhancing the skill set of existing HNPs helps address potential shortages and ensures a competent workforce is available to meet patient needs. Training HNPs will also be cost-effective, as it reduces long-term healthcare costs by preventing complications and hospitalizations through better management and early intervention in HIV-related health issues. WPHO will also use the funds to conduct above-site monitoring of already trained HNPs in the districts. The monitoring will also facilitate feedback and improvement, as it provides an opportunity for HNPs to receive feedback on their performance, identify areas for improvement, and allow targeted support or refresher training as needed to enhance their skills. There will also be enhanced accountability as regular monitoring fosters accountability among HNPs, encouraging them to adhere to established protocols and guidelines in HIV management, which can lead to improved health outcomes for patients. The process will also assist in identifying training gaps for future consideration, as this above-site monitoring can identify specific areas where HNPs may require additional training or resources, ensuring that ongoing education is aligned with the challenges they face in practice.

The Westmoreland County Youth Summit was held on February 4, 2025.

This Youth Summit provided a forum for young people to organize, network, utilize PAYS data and share their hopes and concerns in a public setting. The summit is an excellent opportunity to build the developmental assets of young participants by learning more about what they experience in the places they spend time and provide the students with knowledge to make positive change. The goal of the summit was to encourage peer-to-peer education by the students at their home schools. The students and advisors left the summit with a plan to conduct an activity or event to educate their peers. Mini grants, through other funding sources, were offered to each school to implement peer-to-peer education surrounding underage drinking at their school.

Payroll Reimbursement: Salary and benefits ($26,705.34) for one staff person providing Youth Substance Use Prevention. Deschutes County youth drug use rates are higher than Oregon State averages, strongly correlated with poor academic and health outcomes. As highlighted in our August 2024 Progress Report, Deschutes County is a vibrant vacation community with heavy economic reliance on Alcohol and Marijuana small businesses and the business sponsorship of community events targeting families. The social acceptance of Alcohol and Marijuana, ease of community availability, and mixed messages to youth about substance use create a risk factor for our youth that the Drug Free Communities (DFC) Coordinator is actively working to mitigate using universal prevention strategies in the following ways:
•	Collaboration with local small businesses, event coordinators, and ODOT to provide information, education, and alternatives in Community Event Spaces where youth are present 
•	Partnership with 2 local colleges on summer safety topics for students, focused on topics like: Narcan and fentanyl test strip trainings, binge drinking education, impaired driving recognition and alternatives
•	Participation in K-12 and college health fairs and parent nights to distribute important safety information

Education & Travel Expenses: Airfare ($669.27 on purchase card), lodging expenses ($2,567.77), and conference registration ($1,490) for two Drug Free Communities (DFC) coalition members and the DFC Coordinator to the 2025 National CADCA Leadership Forum*. The coordination and existence of a community coalition are required activities per the CDC/ONDCP DFC grant. A protective factor outlined in our 2024 Progress Report is focused on the power and quality of the parent-child connection and its impact on overall health but specifically substance use initiation. The coalition members attended sessions to educate them on the facilitation of and enhancement of programs providing support and education to increase parents’ efficacy when having difficult conversations with their kids. This education is necessary for our coalition to deliver quality and up to date programming for parents, inform our social norm media campaign on how to ‘Start the Conversation’ with their youth, and continue to support the school district in management of youth who may be initiating use of substances.

Print Materials: A core activity of our award is increasing access to treatment and services. Printing expenses were incurred during this timeframe in order to share information about treatment and services in collaboration with the school district for impacted youth at two of the CADCA Conference breakout sessions. Business cards ($53.50) were also printed for the DFC Coordinator who serves as the grant project coordinator and was new to the role April 2024 and needs to provide contact information to counterparts. 

Indirect: Deschutes County elects to claim de minimis (10% at time of NOA) = $3,148.59

04/29/2025,34302.49,HHS-CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION,Not available,,"The comprehensive outline below provides a breakdown of all line items on our invoice to ensure clarity and alignment with your records.

$12,612.64 - Salaries and Wages 
Project Coordinator (Sher Rowley) provides critical leadership to ensure that project activities are implemented with fidelity to the approved strategic plan. Her responsibilities include coordinating coalition efforts, overseeing program implementation, managing timelines, and ensuring grant objectives are met. Her consistent engagement helps maintain alignment with federal program expectations and ensures accountability across all activities.

Business Official (Gina DeSantis) plays a vital operational role by overseeing administrative and financial processes related to the grant. She ensures compliance with budgetary requirements, manages financial reporting, and supports the timely execution of project expenditures. Her oversight is instrumental in keeping the project on track and ensuring that all fiscal responsibilities are met efficiently.
Both staff members' expertise and commitment are essential to the project's integrity, efficiency, and success. 

$6,534.52 - Fringe Benefits: 
Fringe benefits include Vision, Dental, Retirement, Health, Medicare, HSA, Life Insurance, and Workers Compensation.

These line items support the contributions of two key personnel essential to successfully implementing and overseeing the grant project: the DFC Project Coordinator and the Business Official.

$4,298.76—Training & Travel: This line item supports the local and out-of-state travel necessary to implement and oversee the DFC grant project effectively.

Local travel includes mileage reimbursement for the project coordinator and assistant coordinator to attend meetings, site visits, and community events directly related to executing the DFC action plan. These activities are essential for maintaining coalition engagement, supporting local prevention strategies, and ensuring project fidelity.

Out-of-state travel covers attendance at the CADCA National Leadership Forum, a premier training event focused on substance use prevention. Participation in this forum allows staff to gain up-to-date knowledge, access national best practices, and strengthen professional networks, which enhances the quality and impact of local programming.

In-state travel includes attendance at the Utah Prevention Coalition Association (UPCA) training in Bryce Canyon. This training provides state-specific guidance, resources, and professional development tailored to prevention professionals working within Utah.

Participation in these events ensures that personnel are equipped with the most current research, skills, and tools in prevention science, which directly supports the goals and sustainability of the DFC project.

USBE Training - This line item supports travel for five (5) coalition members to attend the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) Prevention Training held in Bryce Canyon, Utah. Our CDC point of contact approved this opportunity as a reallocation of previously designated funds for the Montana Institute due to scheduling conflicts that prevent coalition members and coordinators from attending the Montana event. The content provided by the Montana Institute will be delivered at the Bryce Canyon training, ensuring no loss in educational value. Attending this training enables coalition members to receive essential professional development in prevention science, expand their knowledge of effective strategies, and strengthen coalition efforts. This investment aligns with our goals for capacity building, sustainability, and community impact.
Mileage reimbursement for Julie Anderson, a dedicated and long-standing volunteer with the Weber Communities That Care (CTC) coalition, to attend the Prevention Specialist Training at the Willow Creek Inn in Ephraim, Utah. Julie’s participation in this training was approved by the Executive Committee as part of the coalition’s commitment to capacity building, member development, and volunteer recognition. Upon completion, Julie will be eligible to become a Certified Prevention Specialist, significantly enhancing her ability to contribute to the coalition’s efforts. Julie is a core Guiding Good Choices program facilitator and a passionate advocate for policy change and substance use prevention. Equipping her with additional tools and training strengthens her impact. It benefits the coalition by enhancing our capacity to drive environmental strategies, advocate for policy-level change, and engage the community through an informed and empowered champion.
Uber rides for two adult advisors and six youth coalition members during their participation in the CADCA National Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C.

Transportation was necessary to facilitate site visits to Arlington National Cemetery, to provide historical and civic context as part of leadership development. The International Spy Museum – to enhance youth engagement through interactive learning on national security and decision-making. Capitol Hill – to meet directly with elected representatives, allowing youth to practice advocacy skills and present their substance use prevention efforts nationally.

These activities aligned with CADCA’s focus on civic engagement, leadership, and policy awareness, and supported youth in applying prevention strategies in real-world contexts. Transportation ensured safety, accessibility, and efficient movement between training sessions and educational visits.

$1031.45 - Supplies: Essential supplies, postage, and printing costs (going towards paper, toner, ink) for the DFC grant project. These supplies are critical to the functioning, reach, communications, and outputs of the DFC project and include printing and production of fliers, meeting and training materials, and overall grant documentation and tracking. 

Appreciation gift of flowers to the presenters of the Executive Committee training on the Social Development Strategy. Providing a small token of appreciation acknowledges the time and expertise presenters share and supports a positive, respectful coalition culture. Recognizing contributions in this way helps reinforce volunteer engagement and strengthens relationships with key stakeholders.

Event and Outreach Equipment: A 10x10 canopy was purchased for use at outdoor community events to increase coalition visibility and provide shelter for staff and materials. Additional items such as storage bins and a label maker support organized, functional use and transport of coalition merchandise and materials.

Technology Protection: An Owl case was purchased to protect the Owl video conferencing device during frequent transportation, preventing damage and reducing the risk of needing a costly replacement.

Meeting and Program Supplies: Ongoing materials are needed for coalition meetings, work group sessions, and Guiding Good Choices (GGC) parenting classes. These include bottled water, plates, utensils, and food boxes to manage refreshments and accommodate leftovers for attendees, which supports participation and engagement, particularly for families attending evening sessions.

Printing and Educational Materials: Funds also support the printing of: Social Development Strategy (SDS) handouts for teacher training and youth application at CADCA events, CADCA Youth awards for students presenting their elevator speeches to legislators, and Infographics on the Social Development Strategy distributed to educators during Read Across America school events.

These supplies are critical for effective coalition operations, promoting awareness, encouraging participation, and ensuring high-quality implementation of program strategies and community outreach efforts.

$6,000.00 - Contractual costs: Evaluation Contract and Consultation with Bach Harrison, LLC to guarantee maintenance with Core Reporting requirements of the DFC grant project. This includes collecting and inputting core measures, creating an evaluation report, providing coalition evaluation support, providing activity evaluation support (e.g., strategy measures, focus group development), and conducting coalition member surveys (youth and adult). Includes monthly meetings to review the action plan and assessment protocols and discuss future data collection and evaluation needs.

$706.71 - Other expenses: Other expenses include payroll processing fees, cell phone allowances for the project coordinator and assistant coordinator, and annual membership dues to CADCA*.

Funds will be used to conduct focus group interviews, evaluate existing glove materials, perform advanced 3D scanning and thermal testing, develop a 3D multi-segment hand thermoregulation model, and run human trials in controlled environments to assess how glove properties, posture, and environment affect blood flow, dexterity, and injury risk.
 
Fishery workers experience disproportionately high rates of hand injuries due to extreme working conditions and poor glove performance. This project will generate critical data, predictive tools, and design guidelines that directly support safer, more functional PPE, in alignment with the NIOSH's goal to reduce the risks of workplace injuries and diseases.

",MN ST DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,
05/02/2025,27489.4,HHS-CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION,Not available,,"The recent announcement of the Foreign Aid freeze by the U.S. Government and subsequent work stop-order by Implementing Partners supported by PEPFAR (USAID and CDC) had resulted in the abrupt disruption of HIV service delivery in many facilities. Consequently, the Ministry of Health had promptly put in measures for continuity of HIV services including by redesigning HIV service provision through the revised minimum HIV service package to ensure that HIV services adhere to the PEPFAR waiver and are sustainable. Despite measures put in place, there are still reports of gaps in the commodity stock levels and challenges in the provision of HIV services both at community and facilities levels. This is more pronounced in the northern half of the country where we have had termination of some of the USAID partners and those that are resuming their activities are yet to operate at full scale.  Given the above situation, there is an urgent need for the National HIV Program team to conduct onsite checks and offer technical support to the various facilities across the country.  

The program is therefore, requesting to draw the approved and concurred with funds totaling US$27,489.40 (Twenty-Seven Thousand Four Hundred Eighty-Nine Dollars Forty Cents Only) from the Year 5 MoH/CDC CoAg Treatment Budget Line under the onsite assessment for continuity of HIV services provision and support supervision. These funds will support program and technical officers with travel expenses which include fuel and per diem (daily subsistence allowance) as per approved government rates. These funds will enable the central level teams comprising Clinical, Pharmacy, Laboratory and Strategic Information Personnel travel to all the provinces, selected districts and facilities (Urban, Peri-Urban and Rural). The activity will focus on determining the commodity stock status, HIV service delivery, and provide onsite guidance on continuity of HIV services as per PEPFAR waiver on life-saving activities as well as the Ministry revised minimum HIV service package. This is also aimed at re-echoing that the MOH/CDC CoAg does NOT and will NOT support services involving family planning, abortions, conferences, gender, diversity equity and inclusion (DEI), transgender surgeries or any other non-life saving services no listed under the PEPFAR limited waiver.

This activity is well aligned with the MoH mandate and award to provide support and strengthen the Ministry’s capacity to provide leadership to the National HIV/AIDS Response through coordination, policy development, mentorship and training under The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The teams will also troubleshoot site level challenges in service delivery and supply chain management. The planned activity will give a detailed report on gaps that may exist across the country regarding commodity availability and HIV service provision. This activity across health facilities is planned for the week beginning 5th May 2025. This activity will reinforce adherence to the PEPFAR waiver conditions which is a critical objective of this MoH Central Level Team visitations to subnational level activities. 

Key Deliverables

MoH needs to offer physical supervision to ascertain continuity of services and adherence to the PEPFAR waiver. While the PHOs and DHOs have already been visiting facilities to offer assessments and support, the MOH Central Team has not been present at f facility level since the stop work order. We are of the opinion that physical presence on the ground of the MOH Central Level Program Leadership will be critical to troubleshoot some of the persisting site level challenges in both HIV service provision and supply chain management. Further, the physical presence of MOH will help them have first-hand experience and understanding on what is obtaining on the ground following the stop work order, enforce adherence to the PEPFAR waiver, and redesign HIV service provision towards sustainability. This is in keeping with the oversight, monitoring and supervisory role of the MOH HIV Program supported by the MOH/CDC CoAg.  However, future assessment will be done by sub-national organs to ensure cost-effectiveness. 

Since this is the first full assessment after PEPFAR funding suspension:
	It will require a higher degree of involvement from MoH HQ to guide the process and ensure accuracy;
	MoH HQ will oversee the development of a clear and replicable assessment protocol that subnational teams can adapt for future iterations and easier onward roll out to other districts / facilities by Sub-National Level Teams.

The visitations or assessments will:
	Identify the optimal ratio of HQ and subnational involvement based on real-world data about current capacity, resource/commodities availability, and implementation challenges.
	Provide actionable insights into where HQ resources will be needed more and where subnational teams can take greater ownership.
	Enable data-driven decision-making to right-size the activity and allocate roles efficiently moving forward.

The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation.

Reasons for request.

Please the reasons we are requesting this drawdown is to permit us to pay our audit report now due for the project period. We are the ministry of public health (MOH), and the audit procedures depend much on the MOH. We had some inevitable challenges which were independent of us. Therefore, these funds drawdown requests are meant to pay the outstanding audits for these periods that were not paid because they were not completed in its entirety. With the payments of all pending reports, it will permit us to submit the final reports as required and request for restrictions on our current budget. The amount requested will cover the pending audits from COP 18 to COP 23.

The software cost of $12,368.25, recorded under the current budget period 04/01/2024 – 03/31/2025, was initially included in anticipation of an approved budget revision. However, the budget amendment is still pending approval, and the amount does not currently align with the approved budget.

The intended cost pertains to TKO’s annual Jotform Enterprise subscription, which is used to support HIPAA-compliant:
	•	Data collection and management
	•	Data sharing and reporting
	•	Case management
	•	Client progress tracking

The total annual cost of the Jotform Enterprise subscription is $13,935.60. TKO is requesting 75% of the cost to be allocated to project activities, which equates to a revised request of $10,452.00 for this budget period.

TKO acknowledges the discrepancy and would like revise the payment request to reflect the appropriate allocation upon approval of the budget amendment.","CDC approves the requested drawdown in line with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the HHSA Grants Policy Statement —Allowability of Costs/Activities.

The current award (2R44CK000621-02A1), Clinical Ecosystem Surfaces for Improved Disinfection Outcomes and the Prevention of HAI* Transmission (*healthcare-associated infection) is an applied research effort aimed at the commercialization of materials technology for surfaces (coatings and bulk materials that include touch surfaces, flooring, fabrics etc.) for use in clinical ecosystems, while noting that other environments (e.g., public transport) will also benefit from the surfaces described. HAIs are expensive to the healthcare system (~$40B annually), their occurrences divert important resources (nurses, doctors, funds), and the problem leads to 13,000 deaths annually. Implementing effective (passive) strategies to reduce the transmission of pathogens within the clinical ecosystem that can work synergistically with current disinfection practices is a logical approach to reduce the incidences of infections, lower healthcare costs, and save lives.

The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project.

The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation.

We also be talking to community members to get them to join the coalition-hence build capacity. ","GMO recommends payment approval.

The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation.

Our staff is in the school weekly educating students on vaping, THC, fentanyl, prescription drug misuse, impaired driving, binge drinking and illegal drug use. 
Drug Free Dickson was recently awarded Blue Ribbon Coalition status from CADCA, the first from the state of TN to receive this award and one of only a few nationwide. We recently had an independent cost benefit analysis conducted by Catalyst Evaluation Group and they determined “For every dollar invested in substance use prevention in Dickson County, Tennessee, a savings of $4.05 in public burden spending is realized.” We are very proud of the progress we are making in youth substance misuse prevention and would not be able to do it without funding from the DFC grant.
This month’s expenses support 3 staff implementing the programs in schools and our community. $7372.87 for staff, $884.98 benefits/taxes, $60 accounting fee for payroll services, $474.05 used to update our website with substance misuse resources for youth.

To reduce TB related mortality, MoH through the National TB and Leprosy Program (NTLP) has continued scaling up use of TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) with over 90% coverage among PLHIV in the country. With short regimens included in the recent disseminated updated TPT guidelines, it was noted during the campaign that most facility staffs were not comfortable initiating patients on newer shorter regimens which are more efficacious and patient friendly.
 
The National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program (NTLP) in collaboration with CDC Zambia will be supporting the Provinces to conduct targeted TPT technical support supervision and mentorship in selected Districts across the country. The main aim is to disseminate the TB Prevention guidelines and increase the use of short treatment regimen.
 
A total approved and concurred with amount of US$18,973.57 is being requested to be drawn down from PMS. These funds will support program and technical officers with travel expenses which include fuel and per diem (daily subsistence allowance) as per approved government rates. These funds will enable the central level teams comprising TB Program, Technical and Clinical Personnel travel to all the provinces, selected districts and facilities (Urban, Peri-Urban and Rural). This activity is well aligned with the MoH mandate and award to provide support and strengthen the Ministry’s capacity to provide leadership to the National TB and HIV/AIDS Response through coordination, policy development, mentorship and training under The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
 
This activity is aimed at improving uptake of TPT and increased usage of short regimen treatment and will be coupled with dissemination of the TPT guidelines in those districts where dissemination was not done by the provincial teams. The objective is to increase the TB prevention. The expected outputs of the activity include:-
 
• Dissemination of the updated TPT guidelines to health care workers Districts where the provinces did not finish;
• Increased initiation of TPT Shorter treatment regimens among eligible populations;
• Increased fidelity to implementation of TPT guidelines; and
• Improved reporting of the indicators related to the TPT guidelines.
 
The anticipated impact is the reduced mortality related to TB. Implementation of this activity will NOT support services involving family planning, abortions, conferences, gender, diversity equity and inclusion (DEI), transgender surgeries or any other non-life saving services no listed under the PEPFAR limited waiver.","CDC approves the requested drawdown in the amount of $7,199.21 for approved training and travel expenses that align with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the HHSA Grants Policy Statement —Allowability of Costs/Activities.

Please note this response applies to multiple payment requests, as indirect is a standard payment request. Under the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200), the FDOH applies its federally negotiated indirect rate when applicable to all allowable salaries and fringe costs incurred quarterly, unless specified otherwise based on the approved grant terms. The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation. This payment request is consistent with the terms of the grant and reflects only allowable expenses in this calculation.

The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project.

04/28/2025,4153.58,HHS-CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION,Not available,,"Safe Yakima Valley's DFC grant is structured in direct response to what our local data has shown is our most pressing youth substance misuse concerns - alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and prescription pills. Safe Yakima Valley focuses on youth substance use PREVENTION - only 3% of federal funds are currently being used for youth prevention efforts while 97% is spent on treatment and recovery. Yet, data shows that prevention is the MOST EFFECTIVE way to reduce youth substance use. In fact, DFC coalitions have reduced youth substance use across all substances by more than 30% since DFC's inception using evidenced-based strategies. Every dollar invested in prevention saves communities $18 in treatment/recovery expenses. Why? Prevention focuses on changes attitudes and behaviors of POPULATIONS. Treatment and recovery are individualized. Prevention costs an average of $263 per person; treatment/recovery costs $6-7 million per person. Addiction is an adolescent disease - over 90% of adults who struggle with substance use disorder indicate they started using substances as a youth. Additionally, youth in rural communities exhibit higher rates of substance use and co-occurring substance use disorders. Prevention is critical to curbing substance use and reducing the effects of the opioid epidemic.
Safe Yakima Valley serves as a Yakima County-wide convening organization tasked with building strategic partnerships, facilitating collaborative planning efforts, and coordinating resources to measurably reduce drug availability/accessibility and drug-related crimes in our community. Safe Yakima Valley works with local law enforcement agencies, first responders, the DEA, local schools, treatment providers, the Wa St Liquor & Cannabis Control Board, and other community members to develop and disseminate effective prevention strategies and activities for youth and community audiences to increase awareness about the harms of youth substance use while simultaneously teaching youth general life skills and drug resistance skills. 
Youth who start their initial substance (typically tobacco, 	alcohol, or marijuana) on or before age 14 have a 34% 	chance of developing a long-term substance use disorder.	If through prevention work, we can delay the initial onset to age 15, the risk drops 5%; if we delay the initial onset until age 16, it drops another 5%; if a child waits until age 18 to try that first sip of alcohol, 	puff of a cigarette, they are unlikely to ever develop a 	long-term SUD. Our evidenced-based prevention efforts teach youth lifeskills and positive social norms; we teach parents the risks of substances and the importance their role plays in prevention (parents are the #1 protective factor). We expose youth to protective factors to offset the risk factors in their lives that may lead them to substance use. 
The current draw is requesting $3,611.81 to cover salaries/fringe for 1.2 FTE as well as 15% deminimus to cover part of our indirect expenses for the month. The majority of our grant funds personnel/fringe. Future draws may request monies for our contract evaluator (to measure the effectiveness of our programs) or general supplies.

Please note this response applies to multiple payment requests, as indirect is a standard payment request. Under the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200), the FDOH applies its federally negotiated indirect rate when applicable to all allowable salaries and fringe costs incurred quarterly, unless specified otherwise based on the approved grant terms. The current approved negotiated indirect cost rate is 30.50%, effective 7/1/24 to 6/30/25. Indirect costs represent real expenses incurred by the department that support federally sponsored activities that cannot be directly attributed to a single project. These include, but are not limited to, costs associated with department-wide administrative support, utilities, building maintenance, IT infrastructure, and compliance services. The indirect cost charge ensures that the department can maintain the infrastructure to support the grant activities/implementation. This payment request is consistent with the terms of the grant and reflects only allowable expenses in this calculation. A copy of the negotiated rate agreement is available upon request.","CDC approves the requested drawdown in line with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the HHSA Grants Policy Statement —Allowability of Costs/Activities.

05/06/2025,3485.56,HHS-CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION,Not available,,"Are you kidding me? Fine. This is a Drug Free Communities grant award. Also known as DFC. In the award there is detailed information regarding exactly what the funds are to be used for. In this draw, the award clearly includes payroll for three positions. Specifically, one full-time position and two part-time positions. The total payroll requirement of those three positions is $3,262.95 every two weeks. There are also payroll processing costs as we use a payroll service of $145 per month due in the first of the month. Then a couple of supplies and postage for the $77.61 balance.

Don't get me wrong. I totally support the effort of identifying fraud and abuse in the Federal Grant system. In fact, I applaud the effort. But, this type of approach is concerning and questionable. It is as if you are asking me to do the job you were paid to do. If you actually researched the award that you are asking me to provide detailed information on, you would have already clearly seen that the award includes three positions and therefore require funds for payroll. If you require detailed information for some pens and pencils and $73 for postage, then so be it. It just seems ridiculous and petty to ask folks like me to spend our time providing this information on basically, milk money. If it is determined that these DFC awards are to terminated and no longer funded, then make the decision, communicate the decision and move on to the next thing. But, there is no reason to ask for detailed information every time a request for allocated, approved and budgeted award amounts are requested.

Limulunga Maternal Retesting Above Site Mentorship and Technical Support to HFs
Funds will be used for maternal retesting mentorship and technical support services for HIV-positive pregnant mothers to enhance improved health outcomes, as regular HIV retesting for pregnant women is crucial for early detection and treatment. This can significantly reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, improving both maternal and infant health outcomes. The above site will also enhance capacity building, which will help healthcare workers develop the necessary skills and knowledge to manage HIV testing, counseling, and treatment effectively. Such development can lead to more competent health care providers who are better equipped to handle HIV cases. Supporting maternal HIV retesting promotes the integration of HIV services into maternal health care. This holistic approach ensures that women receive comprehensive care, addressing both their pregnancy needs and HIV management.","CDC approves the requested drawdown in line with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the HHSA Grants Policy Statement —Allowability of Costs/Activities.
