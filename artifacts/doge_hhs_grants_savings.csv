3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,INTERNATIONAL FERTILITY RESEARCH PROGRAM,108743247,44188335,,"Abstract: The novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes Coronavirus Disease – 2019 (COVID-19) is a significant threat to public health. SARS-CoV-2 is both highly transmissible, as is evidenced by the current pandemic, and can lead to clinically significant COVID-19 disease. In severe and critical cases SARS-CoV-2 infection causes progressive pulmonary infection, complicated by respiratory failure, with a high prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Out of all age groups, older adults have the greatest risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 disease and its associated complications (CDC 2020; Grabowski and Mor 2020). Globally, there are a number of reports of COVID-19 rapidly spreading among the residents of skilled nursing facilities. Sadly, these nursing home residents also have high associated rates of both morbidity and mortality (Arons et al. 2020; Grabowski and Mor 2020; Graham et al. 2020). In the United States (US), at least 153,000 nursing home residents and employees have contracted COVID-19 disease and account for 35% of the country’s deaths (Werner et al. 2020). With more than 1.3 million Americans living in nursing homes (CDC 2016), there is an urgent need for effective, preventative strategies. CoVPN 3501 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylaxis study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the intravenous mAb, LY3819253, in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, compared to placebo. It is expected that 1700-2400 participants (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) will be randomly assigned to study intervention such that approximately 1300 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants are randomized in the study with the goal of achieving approximately 33 events (in each of the primary and key secondary endpoints). This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), LY3819253, in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in nursing home facility staff and residents."

NOVEL VACCINES AGAINST SARS-COV-2 HAVE ALTERED THE PANDEMICâ€™S TRAJECTORY. YET, LARGE POPULATIONS REMAIN AT RISK, AND IMMUNE ESCAPE VIRUS VARIANTS THREATEN TO THWART VACCINE ACTION OR CURRENT THERAPIES. NEW SMALL MOLECULE ANTIVIRAL DRUGS AVAILABLE AS ORAL TREATMENTS IN THE OUTPATIENT SETTING ARE NEEDED TO TREAT SARS-COV-2 INFECTIONS, OTHER CORONAVIRUSES, AND ADDITIONAL VIRUSES OF PANDEMIC CONCERN. COVID-19 HAS HELPED REJOIN LARGE PHARMA IN ANTI-INFECTIVE DRUG DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE REMAINS A GAP IN THE EARLY DRUG DISCOVERY PHASE, WHICH CAN BE MET BY ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS ENGAGED IN DRUG DISCOVERY THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY. ACADEMIC GROUPS HAVE GREAT BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS AND PLATFORMS FOR NOVEL DISCOVERY RESULTING IN IDENTIFICATION OF NEW TARGETS, HITS, AND LEADS. YET, THEY RARELY HAVE THE WAYS OR MEANS TO OPTIMIZE COMPOUNDS AND ADVANCE THEM FOR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP CAN BRIDGE THIS GAP AND HAVE CREATED THE METROPOLITAN ANTIVIRAL DRUG ACCELERATOR (MAVDA). IT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATIVE ENTERPRISE OF ACADEMIC AND PHARMA PARTNERS IN NEW YORK CITY AND NORTHERN NEW JERSEY BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A COMMON DISCOVERY ECOSYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE URGENT NEED FOR VALIDATED SMALL-MOLECULE ANTIVIRAL DRUGS. MAVDA COMBINES WORLD-CLASS VIROLOGISTS AND ACADEMIC DRUG DISCOVERY RESEARCHERS FROM ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND MEMORIAL SLOAN- KETTERING CANCER CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY AND THE CENTER FOR DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION AND RUTGERS UNIVERSITY IN NEW JERSEY WITH PROVEN ANTIVIRAL DRUG DEVELOPERS AT MERCK & CO., INC., THE TRI-INSTITUTIONAL THERAPEUTICS DISCOVERY INSTITUTE (TRI-I TDI)-TAKEDA PHARMACEUTICALS, AND ALIGOS THERAPEUTICS, AS A COHESIVE ENTERPRISE TO DELIVER NEW ANTIVIRAL DRUGS. A CRITICAL INNOVATION OF THE ACCELERATOR IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE AND INTEGRATED NETWORK OF PHARMA-STYLE SCIENCE CORES WITH HIGHLY EXPERIENCED CORE DIRECTORS, WHICH ENSURES THAT COMPOUND IDENTIFICATION AND OPTIMIZATION PROCEEDS EFFICIENTLY. STANDARDIZED THRESHOLD â€œGATINGâ€ METRICS FOR COMPOUND PROGRESSION WITH CLEAR â€˜GO/NO GOâ€™ CRITERIA WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF QUALIFIED DRUG CANDIDATES. MAVDA PROJECTS UNITE ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY INVESTIGATORS WITH INNOVATIVE AND WELL-ESTABLISHED DRUG DISCOVERY PLATFORMS WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON VALIDATED TARGETS LIKE 3CLPRO, BUT ALSO EXPLOIT OTHER IMPORTANT TARGETS LIKE NSP14 AND NSP16 MTASE, EXON, PLPRO, NSP13 HELICASE, RDRP, AS WELL AS NOVEL TARGETS. PROMISING HITS, EARLY LEADS, AND OPTIMIZED LEADS AT OR NEAR THE IND ENABLING/DE-RISKING STAGE ARE REPRESENTED, ALONG WITH INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR NEW NATURAL PRODUCT DISCOVERY. ALL PROGRAMS TARGET SARS-COV-2 BUT ALSO ADDRESS OTHER CORONAVIRUSES, FLAVIVIRUSES AND/OR ALPHAVIRUSES. MAVDA IS ROBUST, EASILY ACCOMMODATES DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS AND NEW VIRUS CHALLENGES, AND IT IS AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY AND PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS."

ALL PRIORITY RNA VIRUSES ENCODE A VIRAL HELICASE DOMAIN IN THEIR GENOMES, AND THEY SHARE HIGH SIMILARITY IN STRUCTURE AND BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES. VIRAL RNA HELICASE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE VIRAL REPLICASE COMPLEX AND IS ESSENTIAL FOR RNA VIRUS REPLICATION. FURTHER, IT SHOWS A HIGH SEQUENCE HOMOLOGY WITHIN THE VIRUS FAMILY (E.G., 100% IDENTITY WITHIN SARS2). CONSEQUENTLY, VIRAL RNA HELICASES CAN SERVE AS A NOVEL ANTIVIRAL TARGET FOR RNA VIRUSES WITH A HIGH BARRIER TO DRUG RESISTANCE. DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS, THE CHUNG LAB HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIVIRALS TARGETING THE ALPHAVIRUS HELICASE DOMAIN (NSP2) AND VALIDATED VIRAL HELICASE AS DRUGGABLE FOR DEVELOPING POTENT ANTIVIRALS. BASED ON THIS SUCCESS, WE HYPOTHESIZE THE VIRAL HELICASE CAN SERVE AS A VALID TARGET FOR SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ANTIVIRALS FOR SARS2 AND OTHER PRIORITY RNA VIRUSES. HERE, WE PROPOSE A COMPREHENSIVE ANTIVIRAL DISCOVERY CAMPAIGN TARGETING VIRAL HELICASE WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH COMBINING ULTRA-HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING AND DNA-ENCODED CHEMISTRY TECHNOLOGY FOLLOWED BY A ROBUST HIT VALIDATION SCHEME WITH ANTIVIRAL TESTING, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY, AND BIOCHEMICAL APPROACHES (AIM 1). FURTHER, WE PROPOSE TO ADVANCE PROMISING VIRAL HELICASE INHIBITOR HITS THROUGH HIT-TO-LEAD DEVELOPMENT, GIVING VALIDATED LEADS AS DRUG DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATES WITH MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY PAIRED WITH AI-BASED DRUG DESIGN, DMPK STUDIES, AND IN VIVO ANTIVIRAL EFFICACY STUDIES (AIM 2). FINALLY, WE WILL DELIVER 1-2 ORALLY BIOAVAILABLE, PATENTABLE, DRUGLIKE IND-ENABLED SMALL MOLECULES (A DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATE + BACKUP) THAT ARE WELL-SUITED FOR TRANSLATION BY A PHARMA PARTNER (AIM 3). OUR PROPOSAL IS SUPPORTED BY OUR DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL HIT COMPOUND (UNC0379) WITH AN ANTI-SARS2 ACTIVITY FROM A PILOT 100,000-COMPOUND LIBRARY SCREEN (CORE B). THE PI AND ESTABLISHED TEAM (CHUNG, VIROLOGY/PI; BANNISTER, MED. CHEM/DEPUTY; SPICER, UHTS; LUO, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY OF VIRAL REPLICASE; RANEY, HELICASE BIOCHEMISTRY) SYNERGISTICALLY COMBINE ANTIVIRAL DRUG DISCOVERY (HEAD-GORDON, COMPCHEM/AI) WITH EXCELLENT CORE SUPPORT (CORE B AND CORE C).

THE SPECIFIC FOCUS OF CAMPP WILL BE TO DEVELOP ANTIVIRALS AGAINST CORONAVIRUSES SARS-COV-2 (SCV2), SARS AND MERS; FLAVIVIRUSES INCLUDING ZIKA, WEST NILE AND DENGUE VIRUS; AND HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUSES INCLUDING THE FILOVIRUS EBOLA, AND BUNYAVIRUSES SEVERE FEVER WITH THROMBOCYTOPENIA SYNDROME VIRUS AND LASSA VIRUS. INFECTION BY ANY OF THESE AGENTS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SEVERE HUMAN DISEASE WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RATES AND CURRENT OPTIONS FOR ANTIVIRAL TREATMENTS ARE LIMITED. THE ANTIVIRAL DRUG REMDESIVIR AND SEVERAL MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TREATMENTS HAVE RECEIVED EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19, AND THE POLYMERASE INHIBITOR MOLNUPIRAVIR BY MERCK IS EXPECTED TO BE GRANTED EUA IN THE NEAR FUTURE. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO TREAT EBOLA VIRUS INFECTION, HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE DRUGS CAN BE ADMINISTERED ORALLY, POSING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IN TREATING EARLY INFECTION. THERE ARE NO APPROVED TREATMENTS FOR THE CAMPP FLAVIVIRUSES AND HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUSES. TOWARD THIS END, WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A WORLD CLASS MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS WITH EXPERTISE IN VIROLOGY OF RELEVANT VIRUSES, STRUCTURAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, CHEMOPROTEOMICS, PHARMACOLOGY AND ORGANOID/ANIMAL MODELS, WHO WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS AT THE DRUG DISCOVERY DIVISION OF THE SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE, CALIBR, TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOUR MAJOR CLASSES OF PROMISING ASSETS IN OUR DRUG DISCOVERY PIPELINE. FIRST, WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A POTENTIALLY BEST-IN-CLASS, ORALLY BIOAVAILABLE CORONAVIRUS PROTEASE (CLPRO) INHIBITOR FOR CORONAVIRUSES INCLUDING SCV2, FROM A LATE-STAGE DRUG ASSET UNDERGOING ADME OPTIMIZATION THAT IS EXPECTED TO ENTER IND-ENABLING STUDIES WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. SECOND, WE WILL IDENTIFY AND OPTIMIZE RNA POLYMERASE INHIBITORS FOR SCV2 AND OTHER CAMPP VIRUSES, WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING IND-ENABLING STUDIES WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE THIRD FOCUS OF OUR PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP ANTIVIRALS AGAINST OTHER â€˜DRUGGABLEâ€™ PROTEINS ENCODED BY SCV2 AND ADDITIONAL VIRUSES POSING A PANDEMIC THREAT; THESE ASSETS INCLUDE INHIBITORS OF SCV2 HELICASE, E-PROTEIN ENCODED ION CHANNEL ACTIVITY, ENTRY AND FUSION ACTIVITIES, AND NUCLEOCAPSID, WITH THE GOAL OF OBTAINING IN VIVO PROOF-OF-CONCEPT FOR A SUBSET OF THESE MID-STAGE ASSETS. FINALLY, WE PROPOSE TO TARGET TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED â€˜UNDRUGGABLEâ€™ NON-ENZYMATIC PROTEINS INCLUDING SCV2 AND FLAVIVIRAL STRUCTURAL PROTEINS AS WELL AS RNA STRUCTURE, TO DEVELOP NOVEL STRATEGIES FOR ANTIVIRAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT. CAMPP PROVIDES A HIGHLY INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE OF INVESTIGATORS, EXPERTISE AND EXTERNAL PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOUNDING PARTNERS THAT WILL ENSURE THE CENTERâ€™S SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING OUR GOALS AND NAVIGATING CHALLENGES OF THE DRUG DISCOVERY PROCESS."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,INTERNATIONAL FERTILITY RESEARCH PROGRAM,22082664,8787242,,"Abstract: The novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes Coronavirus Disease – 2019 (COVID-19) is a significant threat to public health. SARS-CoV-2 is both highly transmissible, as is evidenced by the current pandemic, and can lead to clinically significant COVID-19 disease. In severe and critical cases SARS-CoV-2 infection causes progressive pulmonary infection, complicated by respiratory failure, with a high prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Out of all age groups, older adults have the greatest risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 disease and its associated complications (CDC 2020; Grabowski and Mor 2020). Globally, there are a number of reports of COVID-19 rapidly spreading among the residents of skilled nursing facilities. Sadly, these nursing home residents also have high associated rates of both morbidity and mortality (Arons et al. 2020; Grabowski and Mor 2020; Graham et al. 2020). In the United States (US), at least 153,000 nursing home residents and employees have contracted COVID-19 disease and account for 35% of the country’s deaths (Werner et al. 2020). With more than 1.3 million Americans living in nursing homes (CDC 2016), there is an urgent need for effective, preventative strategies. CoVPN 3501 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylaxis study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the intravenous mAb, LY3819253, in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, compared to placebo. It is expected that 1700-2400 participants (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) will be randomly assigned to study intervention such that approximately 1300 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants are randomized in the study with the goal of achieving approximately 33 events (in each of the primary and key secondary endpoints). This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), LY3819253, in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in nursing home facility staff and residents."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,31842477,8037749,,"Project Abstract Efforts to control the pandemic have resulted in widespread shelter-in-place orders. Transmission of SARS- CoV-2 occurs primarily through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplet transmission (Lai,2020). Household contacts of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at a high risk for acquiring infection, with transmission rates ranging from approximately 10% to 15%. The majority of individuals who acquire infection from household contacts develop symptoms of COVID-19(Burke,2020) (Jing, 2020), (Bi,2020) (Li,2020b). Prophylaxis is urgently needed to reduce transmission rates and/or reduce the occurrence of symptomatic disease. Ideally, prophylaxis would need to be given as soon as possible after a known exposure, as the duration of time between symptomatic infection in the source individual and the development of symptoms in newly infected individual is thought to be approximately 5 days, with a possible range of 2 to14 days(Lauer,2020) (Li,2020a). Animal models suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal (NP) samples become positive within a few days after infection (Rockx,2020). An ideal agent for prophylaxis should be fast acting and highly effective and should protect against multiple viral variants. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination therapy, with two different monoclonal antibodies that bind distinct regions of the portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) protein that bind to and facilitate entry into host cells, has been developed in order to achieve these goals. A mAb combination against SARS-CoV-2 for post-exposure prophylaxis that can either prevent the development of disease or reduce viral acquisition or shedding could be key to reducing transmission of the virus and limiting symptoms and adverse outcomes following infection. Currently, however, there is no approved prophylaxis for COVID-19 nor for patients that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are asymptomatic. Given the speed at which this outbreak has spread and how it has impacted almost every community globally, there is an urgent need to develop safe and efficacious interventions to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and decrease adverse outcomes associated with symptomatic disease. This is a pivotal phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with household contact exposure to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in geographic areas with an active COVID-19 outbreak. This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of co-administered REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy (“REGN10933+REGN10987”) to reduce the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and prevent the development of COVID-19 disease (symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection), after household exposure to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of REGN10933+REGN10987 will also be evaluated."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,Duke University,86836635,7524803,,"ABSTRACT There is an urgent need to reduce disparities in COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality outcomes in historically marginalized and vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this need the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) program will support Community-Engaged Testing Research Projects and Social, Ethical and Behavioral Implications (SEBI) Research Projects to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection patterns and increase access and effectiveness of diagnostic methods in underserved and/or vulnerable populations. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), the UNC Center for Health Equity Research (CHER), and Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH) propose to serve as the Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC) to provide management, direction, and overall coordination of the RADx-UP consortium. Together, our multidisciplinary experience in project coordination; COVID-19 thought leadership; regulatory science; community engagement; health equity research; social justice; adult and child research; statistics; data science; and clinical research informatics will advance the objectives of the projects in the RADx-UP Program. Our overarching goal is to implement a community-centered approach and establish an effective, flexible, participatory, and sustainable CDCC that will serve as the infrastructure to maximize the community impact of projects in the RADx-UP Program. To achieve this vision, we will establish a program framework comprised of four cores. Our Administration and Coordination Core, in collaboration with NIH scientific staff, will facilitate the work of the RADx-UP Program in overarching administrative management. The COVID-19 Testing Core will advise and guide COVID-19 testing protocols; curate emergent testing data; and administer the Rapid Pilot Studies Program. The Community and Health System Engagement Core will support a community of practice across the RADx-UP Program; provide support in exchanging best practices across communities on recruitment, engagement, and retention of study participants; and coordinate the dissemination of study findings from RADx-UP projects. The Data Science and Biostatistics Core will manage data collection, integration, and sharing for the RADx-UP Program including merging and harmonization of multiple and diverse data sources and provide data standards, data collection design, and biostatistics consulting services. The RADx-UP CDCC goals will be met using established infrastructure and subject matter experts and will be customized to meet the variable needs of the RADx-UP community. Using the highest research standards, our team will accomplish the goals set out by the NIH in managing this critically important collaborative effort."

Addressing this gap, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) led rapid constitution of the CoVPN, partnering 5 NIH supported clinical trial networks, to create an enhanced network of physician-scientists at 145 United States (US) and 71 international clinical trial sites in 17 countries dedicated to developing globally effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Due to its extensive experience implementing global HIV vaccine trials over the last 20 years, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) LOC was selected as the LOC for CoVPN vaccine trials. This Phase 3, multi-stage, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-armed study will test the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Sanofi-Pasteur SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, monovalent D614 (monovalent vaccine) & SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, bivalent D614/B.1.351 (bivalent vaccine), to modify COVID-19 disease in adults 18 years of age and older. Participants will be recruited from clinical trial sites across the US and globally using data analytics to target high risk individuals with a diverse racial and ethnic profile. Participants will receive symptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they become infected will be monitored with frequent clinical check-ins and remote monitoring of vital signs. Infected individuals who progress to moderate-severe COVID-19 will be referred for hospitalization. All trial endpoint assays will be done using qualified and validated assays for diagnosis and immune monitoring. Specific aims of this study are to assess the clinical efficacy of the investigational CoV2 preS dTM recombinant protein adjuvanted with AS03 – both monovalent and bivalent (“study vaccines”) in naïve adults for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 occurring > 14 days after the second injection; to assess the safety of the study vaccines compared to placebo throughout the study; to assess, in participants who are SARS-CoV-2 naïve, the clinical efficacy of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccines for prevention of the following occurring > 14 days after the second injection: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prevention of severe COVID-19; to describe the frequency & spectrum of disease in episodes of symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve adults in each study group. This efficacy trial will tell us much about the ability of two recombinant vaccines, targeting two of the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants, to induce strong adaptive protective responses. After the Novavax vaccine, this is the second large scale recombinant protein vaccine to be tested for efficacy and it is the first trial to use a bivalent vaccine including the B.1.351 variant of concern. If successful, this will be an important vaccine that can be scaled up rapidly and deployed throughout the world. The results of this trial will be used to assess registration of this vaccine product and will also provide crucial information to inform future generations of COVID-19 vaccines."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER CENTER,83440030,7393274,,"Project Abstract Efforts to control the pandemic have resulted in widespread shelter-in-place orders. Transmission of SARS- CoV-2 occurs primarily through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplet transmission (Lai,2020). Household contacts of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at a high risk for acquiring infection, with transmission rates ranging from approximately 10% to 15%. The majority of individuals who acquire infection from household contacts develop symptoms of COVID-19(Burke,2020) (Jing, 2020), (Bi,2020) (Li,2020b). Prophylaxis is urgently needed to reduce transmission rates and/or reduce the occurrence of symptomatic disease. Ideally, prophylaxis would need to be given as soon as possible after a known exposure, as the duration of time between symptomatic infection in the source individual and the development of symptoms in newly infected individual is thought to be approximately 5 days, with a possible range of 2 to14 days(Lauer,2020) (Li,2020a). Animal models suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal (NP) samples become positive within a few days after infection (Rockx,2020). An ideal agent for prophylaxis should be fast acting and highly effective and should protect against multiple viral variants. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination therapy, with two different monoclonal antibodies that bind distinct regions of the portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike(S) protein that bind to and facilitate entry into host cells, has been developed in order to achieve these goals. A mAb combination against SARS-CoV-2 for post-exposure prophylaxis that can either prevent the development of disease or reduce viral acquisition or shedding could be key to reducing transmission of the virus and limiting symptoms and adverse outcomes following infection. Currently, however, there is no approved prophylaxis for COVID-19 nor for patients that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are asymptomatic. Given the speed at which this outbreak has spread and how it has impacted almost every community globally, there is an urgent need to develop safe and efficacious interventions to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and decrease adverse outcomes associated with symptomatic disease. This is a pivotal phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with household contact exposure to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in geographic areas with an active COVID-19 outbreak. This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of co-administered REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy (“REGN10933+REGN10987”) to reduce the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and prevent the development of COVID-19 disease (symptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection), after household exposure to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of REGN10933+REGN10987 will also be evaluated."

IN 2008, THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH OPENED A REGIONAL BIOCONTAINMENT LABORATORY (RBL). RESEARCH AT THE RBL HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THEN, WITH INVESTIGATORS WORKING ON SEVERAL HIGHLY INFECTIOUS MICROBIAL AGENTS REQUIRING BSL2 AND ABSL2 FACILITIES. CURRENT RBL RESEARCH PROJECTS COVER MULTIPLE VIRUSES IN 5 OF THE 7 RNA VIRUS FAMILIES OF PANDEMIC CONCERN AS DEFINED BY NIH, INCLUDING, BUNYAVIRALES, CORONAVIRIDAE, FLAVIVIRIDAE, PARAMYXOVIRIDAE, AND TOGAVIRIDAE. THE RBL IS AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE US, EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA. INDEED, THE RBL RECEIVED THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS IN MID-FEBRUARY, 2020, AND RECEIVED ALMOST $5M IN MARCH 2020 FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS TO PURSUE VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOR COVID-19. THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE RBL IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE US TO CONDUCT THE NECESSARY RESEARCH TO BE PREPARED FOR THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF VACCINES AND THERAPEUTICS IN RESPONSE TO FUTURE PANDEMICS SIMILAR TO THE RECENT SARS-COV-2. OVER THE LAST 14 YEARS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES IN THE RBL HAVE BEGUN TO DEGRADE, WITH SOME REACHING THE END OF THEIR USEFULNESS. THE FOCUS OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO MODERNIZE THE RBL THROUGH BOTH UPGRADES AND RENOVATIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH ON INFECTIOUS AGENTS OF PANDEMIC CONCERN FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RBL IS A VITAL TOOL FOR PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS, 3 AREAS OF RBL FUNCTIONALITY AND EFFICIENCY WILL BE ADDRESSED. FIRST, WE WILL ENHANCE RBL SAFETY AND LONGEVITY. REPAIRS OR REPLACEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO THE BIO- CONTAINMENT FLOORING, THE SUPPLY AIR SYSTEM, THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES, CHILLER CONTROLS, STEAM WATER HEATERS, DIESEL ENGINE GENERATOR FUEL SYSTEM CONTROLS, FIRE ALARM SYSTEM, BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM, WALK-IN COOLER, AND BIOMETRIC SECURITY. SECOND, THE EFFICIENCY OF RBL OPERATIONS WILL BE ENHANCED BY REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SYSTEM LIGHTING WITH ENERGY-EFFICIENT LED LIGHTS AND REMOVAL OF A GAS PLASMA STERILIZER TO GENERATE MUCH NEEDED SPACE. THIRD, THE RESEARCH CAPACITY OF THE RBL WILL BE ENHANCED BY INCREASING RODENT HOUSING CAPACITY AND PURCHASING ADDITIONAL CAGING FOR NON-HUMAN PRIMATES, RABBITS, AND FERRETS. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ENSURE THE RBL REMAINS FUNCTIONAL, EFFICIENT, AND READY FOR RAPID RESPONSE TO FUTURE EMERGING PANDEMICS."

Rockefeller faculty have played an outsized role in contributions to foundational discoveries in virology and infectious disease, both historically and presently. Recognizing the importance of the current pandemic, over the past two years, a dozen research groups at Rockefeller have joined the research efforts focused on pandemic threat viruses, with numerous grants supporting the work and over 50 peer-reviewed publications to date. Rockefeller labs have made seminal contributions identifying the spectrum of neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the impact of variants on neutralization, and characterizing the atomic- resolution binding of antibodies to spike protein. Collectively, Rockefeller laboratories are working on Alphaviruses (e.g., Sindbis, chikungunya viruses), Flaviviruses (e.g., yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, Powassan viruses), Hepaciviruses (hepatitis C virus, Norway rat hepacivirus), Hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B virus), Orthomyxoviruses (influenza), Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses) and retroviruses including HIV-1. Many of the viruses under study, including chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, Powassan, and SARS-CoV-2, are classified as Risk Group 3 (RG3) pathogens, requiring BSL3 containment facilities and practices. Moreover, some research at Rockefeller includes the generation of replicons and chimeric (VSV- based) viruses whose stability and safety should be established under BSL3 conditions prior to use at lower biosafety containment levels. This project seeks to enhance and expand space and support for both in vivo and in vitro research. Specific aim 1 is to increase the Rockefeller University’s BSL3 capacities to meet the scientific needs by establishing a new BSL3 facility in an existing laboratory building. Specific aim 2 is to equip and enhance the new facility and the BSL3/ABSL3 facilities that already exist at the University. To achieve these aims, an extremely experienced team of personnel at Rockefeller propose to: establish a new multiple- investigator BSL3 facility; add equipment to the existing single-PI BSL3 facility; replace an existing autoclave and add an incremental autoclave in the ABSL3; and modernize the supporting infrastructure in the ABSL3."

The ITN is structured in order to interrogate different diseases across the immunologic spectrum, with integration of innovative clinical studies and cutting edge immunology laboratory analysis. The ITN approach—clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while we simultaneously evaluate the cellular, genetic, and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how they are altered in response to therapy—creates a framework for advancing cross-disease and cross-discipline knowledge, all designed to accelerate therapeutic options for major diseases. In this renewal application, we describe the scientific and operational framework that will enable the ITN to successfully enhance the development of tolerance therapies in transplantation, autoimmunity, and allergy. We outline a process to evolve our current strategies into the next generation of planned trials, as well as how we plan to operate a nimble, future-focused organization, poised to lead and adopt innovations that are currently unknown. We propose a collaborative structure involving hundreds of investigators, advisors, and clinical sites working in tandem with a core group of ITN staff, operating a program that is both scientifically and financially efficient. Several new innovations recently adopted by the ITN will encourage widespread involvement from academic investigators, including expanded resource sharing and data sharing operations. With lead institutional commitment from the Benaroya Research Institute and the University of California San Francisco, and participation of more than 20 other major institutions represented in leadership and major advisory roles, the ITN strives to continue to successfully pioneer high impact clinical trials and mechanistic studies in areas of unmet medical need."

Addressing this gap, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) led rapid constitution of the CoVPN, partnering 5 NIH supported clinical trial networks, to create an enhanced network of physician-scientists at 145 United States (US) and 71 international clinical trial sites in 17 countries dedicated to developing globally effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Due to its extensive experience implementing global HIV vaccine trials over the last 20 years, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) LOC was selected as the LOC for CoVPN vaccine trials. This Phase 3, multi-stage, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-armed study will test the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Sanofi-Pasteur SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, monovalent D614 (monovalent vaccine) & SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, bivalent D614/B.1.351 (bivalent vaccine), to modify COVID-19 disease in adults 18 years of age and older. Participants will be recruited from clinical trial sites across the US and globally using data analytics to target high risk individuals with a diverse racial and ethnic profile. Participants will receive symptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they become infected will be monitored with frequent clinical check-ins and remote monitoring of vital signs. Infected individuals who progress to moderate-severe COVID-19 will be referred for hospitalization. All trial endpoint assays will be done using qualified and validated assays for diagnosis and immune monitoring. Specific aims of this study are to assess the clinical efficacy of the investigational CoV2 preS dTM recombinant protein adjuvanted with AS03 – both monovalent and bivalent (“study vaccines”) in naïve adults for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 occurring > 14 days after the second injection; to assess the safety of the study vaccines compared to placebo throughout the study; to assess, in participants who are SARS-CoV-2 naïve, the clinical efficacy of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccines for prevention of the following occurring > 14 days after the second injection: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prevention of severe COVID-19; to describe the frequency & spectrum of disease in episodes of symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve adults in each study group. This efficacy trial will tell us much about the ability of two recombinant vaccines, targeting two of the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants, to induce strong adaptive protective responses. After the Novavax vaccine, this is the second large scale recombinant protein vaccine to be tested for efficacy and it is the first trial to use a bivalent vaccine including the B.1.351 variant of concern. If successful, this will be an important vaccine that can be scaled up rapidly and deployed throughout the world. The results of this trial will be used to assess registration of this vaccine product and will also provide crucial information to inform future generations of COVID-19 vaccines."

IN RESPONSE TO THIS CALL, WE ASSEMBLED THE PAN-CORONAVIRUS VACCINE (PANCOVAC) CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP AND TEST NOVEL PAN-CORONAVIRUS VACCINES. RESEARCH PROJECT 1 (RP1; DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF PAN- COV VACCINES) USES TWO STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP BROADLY PROTECTIVE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES: (I) FOCUS IMMUNE RESPONSES AWAY FROM THE IMMUNODOMINANT EPITOPES IN THE HEAD REGION OF S AND TOWARDS THE MORE CONSERVED, IMMUNE-SUBDOMINANT EPITOPES IN THE STEM REGION OF S; AND (II) REFOCUS IMMUNE RESPONSES FROM THE VARIABLE IMMUNODOMINANT EPITOPES TOWARDS MORE CONSERVED EPITOPES IN THE HEAD REGION OF S. FOR EACH STRATEGY, SEVERAL INNOVATIVE APPROACHES WILL BE USED. NOVEL ANTIGENS WILL BE PRESENTED BY VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES BASED ON A SELF- ASSEMBLING BACTERIOPHAGE COAT PROTEIN (A HIGHLY IMMUNOGENIC PLATFORM). THE CANDIDATE VACCINES WILL BE TESTED FOR THEIR IMMUNOGENICITY AND PROTECTIVE EFFICACY AGAINST DIFFERENT CORONAVIRUSES IN AN ANIMAL MODEL.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center was among the first VTEUs funded and has led pivotal studies of influenza, pertussis, pneumococcus, smallpox, and malaria vaccines. The Vanderbilt VTEU has a proven capacity to enroll healthy populations rapidly, including participating in two NIH- directed influenza pandemic responses since 2009, as well as expertise enrolling special populations such as pregnant women, infants and children, adults with underlying medical comorbidities, and the elderly. In the current application, we have expanded our ability to recruit across the lifespan and across multiple pathogens, including increased expertise in sexually transmitted infections, malaria, and novel approaches to conducting clinical trial visits in the home setting. The Vanderbilt VTEU has also led efforts to train the next generation of vaccinologists and clinical trial experts in infectious diseases, including the development of a vaccinology fellowship, participation of fellows and junior faculty in protocol teams and data safety committees, and encouraging concept development by junior faculty. The Vanderbilt VTEU is also committed to working collaboratively with the newly formed Infectious Diseases Leadership Group to articulate priorities for ID research."

The emphasis (and strength) of the IDCRCLG is to facilitate, plan and help implement clinical research for respiratory and enteric infections, malaria/tropical diseases, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and to respond to emerging infectious diseases (EID). Priority research will include interventional trials and clinical research studies for vaccines, biologics, therapeutics, diagnostics and devices targeting these infectious diseases. The LG’s experts and their programs at the eight universities and beyond have a historic record of accomplishment in vaccine and therapeutic clinical research, and immunologic and pathogenesis studies for these NIAID-priority infectious diseases. The LG brings extensive expertise with the conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials including first- in-human studies, cutting-edge human immunology, pharmacokinetics; engagement with diverse populations both nationally/internationally, sIRBs, innovative public-private partnerships, and Investigational New Drug applications (INDs). The group also has strong connectivity to and will leverage NIH/NIAID-supported networks; extensive experience in collaborating with industry partners and foundations, and leadership of complex administrative consortia. This cadre of diverse infectious diseases experts proposes to establish and operate with NIAID and the reconstituted Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs), an integrated, highly- functional, efficient IDCRC to develop innovative scientific and operational strategies in priorities such as vaccines and STI clinical research. The organizational structure supporting the science and operations of the IDCRCLG is composed of a Leadership Operations Center including Expert Working Groups, a Clinical Operations Unit, a Laboratory Operations Unit, and a Statistical and Data Science Unit. Key functions of the LG are to propose, review and prioritize innovative concepts; to enhance integration and efficiency in operations; to form collaborative teams; to ensure quality and timely protocol implementation; to disseminate the results; to promote integration of all populations in IDCRC research across the human lifespan; and to attract, engage and retain the next generation of scientists in infectious diseases clinical research. In addition, the LG’s experience with EID threats, links to global partners/sites, access to the highest-level clinical and laboratory containment facilities and to large populations will help the IDCRC to respond rapidly (surge capacity) during a public health emergency. The LG’s decades of experience with public health, regulatory agencies, product development pipelines further enhance this capacity. The IDCRCLG and the institutions they represent are committed through dedicated PI/leadership effort, space, infrastructure and direct funds to develop the IDCRC."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,"WESTAT, INC",4000000,4000000,,"Over the past three decades, there have been alarming upward trends in the rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. Overall, the identified clinical causes of maternal death are: cardiovascular conditions (14%), hemorrhage (13%), infection (11%) embolism (10%), cardiomyopathy (95), mental health conditions (9%) and preeclampsia/eclampsia (8%) but these conditions vary by race/ethnicity. For Black, non-Hispanic women, the two leading causes of death were cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular conditions, and mental conditions was the leading cause among White, non-Hispanic women.1 Obesity, hypertension, smoking, opioid use and sleep disorders are also conditions and behaviors that have been found to be associated with maternal morbidity such as hemorrhage, preeclampsia and cardiomyopathy. These could potentially be addressed in primary care before and between pregnancies.2-6 The National Heart, Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) is participating in a trans-National Institutes of Health (NIH) effort to improve women’s health, particularly maternal morbidity and mortality. A plan – Advancing Science for the Health of Women, The Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research – was developed for the period 2019 – 2023. This plan provides a framework that recognizes the complex interactions of multiple factors that affect women’s health across the life course, including pregnancy. Life course theory posits that health development begins before conception and continues across the life span. It suggests that a complex play of biologic, behavioral, psychological, and social protective and risk factors contribute to health outcomes, and that health status reflects the cumulative lifetime exposure to these factors. The guiding principles for this plan are consideration of the complex factors affecting women’s health, the inclusion of diverse populations that are disproportionately affected by morbidity and mortality, and active engagement of a diverse group of scientists.7 The NIH approach to reducing maternal morbidity and mortality will aim to enhance health disparities research, increase the understanding of social determinants and other risk factors (including environmental risk factors), improve care (antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum) and management, provide insight to psychological exposures such as stress, discrimination and caregiving, understand coping behaviors in families affected by maternal morbidity or mortality, and investigate the role of implicit bias in the health care systems regarding pregnancy.8 Within NHLBI, maternal and women’s health priorities span all of the objectives of the NHLBI strategic vision, and NHLBI has supported a number of maternal health programs looking at hypertension, sleep disorders, and other pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. The goal of the NHLBI 3M Administrative Coordinating Center (3M ACC) is to engage communities and networks in areas that experience high levels of maternal morbidity and mortality. The 3M ACC will support the preliminary work necessary to identify and prepare a group of community-based organizations to respond to future funding opportunities. The 3M ACC will develop the infrastructure to support this group of Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Regional Coalitions (3M RCs) and provide scientific support and coordination to NHLBI on emerging scientific needs. Specifically, the 3M ACC will support these programmatic objectives: • Identify research groups and organizations with existing and relevant expertise and community partnerships. • Conduct landscape analyses and community-informed needs assessments. • Identify within each community implementation opportunities and barriers to improve delivery of evidence-based care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. • Develop and conduct early-stage tests of implementation approaches to identify potential strategies to ensure the proposed approaches a"

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,9606309,3837357,,"Abstract Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat to human health, with many types of infections having far-reaching, global consequences. The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and 5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health policy. This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal to address important and complicated public health research priorities. Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models, and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance."

The goal of the VTEUs is to initiate innovative concepts for clinical research and implement clinical site protocols for evaluating vaccines, other preventive biologics, therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, and CVD is uniquely poised to accomplish this goal. CVD's expert and accomplished investigative team has complementary skill sets in all areas necessary to address the NIAID priority areas, with established management plans to effectively allocate work and conduct multiple projects simultaneously. CVD is internationally recognized for our capacity and capability to conduct controlled human infection trials for malaria, influenza, and enteric pathogens and to implement treatment and prevention trials in endemic areas for malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTD), both of which have been a focus of its research for many years. CVD has access to U.S. populations of healthy subjects in all age groups for this research and subjects with special risks, such as patients attending outpatient clinics with sexually transmitted infection (STI) and other conditions that generally do not requiring hospitalization. Strong domestic collaborations at sites experienced in clinical trials provide the CVD's VTEU with surge capacity among healthy subjects of all ages and vulnerable populations such as pregnant women in the U.S. to address public health emergencies. CVD's international collaborators, including two long-standing permanent field sites in Africa, are an invaluable resource for vetted international trial sites in low resource countries endemic for malaria and NTD with experience in conducting high quality NIAID and VTEU studies. This proposal describes mechanisms to implement protocols that arise from concepts proposed by the Leadership Group (LG) and the research community including investigators from other VTEUs, academia, industry, non-governmental organizations, and DMID. These concepts will focus on NIAID priority areas, including malaria, NTD, respiratory infections, particularly influenza, enteric diseases, STI, and emerging infectious diseases and other infectious disease considerations. Under our VTEU contract that is nearing completion (2013-2023), CVD was awarded over 23 Task Orders, enrolled over 1,500 participants, and successfully collaborated with national and international sites. This renewal application is intended to supplement the new VTEU award (1UM1AI148689) that we received in December, 2019 in response to AI18-046; funding for this award was limited to one year as a result of an omission by our Sponsored Programs Administration to include a request for 7 full years of funding. The current proposal seeks to supplement that one year award with an additional 6 years of funding."

Addressing this gap, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) led rapid constitution of the CoVPN, partnering 5 NIH supported clinical trial networks, to create an enhanced network of physician-scientists at 145 United States (US) and 71 international clinical trial sites in 17 countries dedicated to developing globally effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Due to its extensive experience implementing global HIV vaccine trials over the last 20 years, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) LOC was selected as the LOC for CoVPN vaccine trials. This Phase 3, multi-stage, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-armed study will test the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Sanofi-Pasteur SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, monovalent D614 (monovalent vaccine) & SARS-CoV2 prefusion Spike delta TM with AS03 adjuvant, bivalent D614/B.1.351 (bivalent vaccine), to modify COVID-19 disease in adults 18 years of age and older. Participants will be recruited from clinical trial sites across the US and globally using data analytics to target high risk individuals with a diverse racial and ethnic profile. Participants will receive symptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they become infected will be monitored with frequent clinical check-ins and remote monitoring of vital signs. Infected individuals who progress to moderate-severe COVID-19 will be referred for hospitalization. All trial endpoint assays will be done using qualified and validated assays for diagnosis and immune monitoring. Specific aims of this study are to assess the clinical efficacy of the investigational CoV2 preS dTM recombinant protein adjuvanted with AS03 – both monovalent and bivalent (“study vaccines”) in naïve adults for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 occurring > 14 days after the second injection; to assess the safety of the study vaccines compared to placebo throughout the study; to assess, in participants who are SARS-CoV-2 naïve, the clinical efficacy of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccines for prevention of the following occurring > 14 days after the second injection: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prevention of severe COVID-19; to describe the frequency & spectrum of disease in episodes of symptomatic COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 non-naïve adults in each study group. This efficacy trial will tell us much about the ability of two recombinant vaccines, targeting two of the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants, to induce strong adaptive protective responses. After the Novavax vaccine, this is the second large scale recombinant protein vaccine to be tested for efficacy and it is the first trial to use a bivalent vaccine including the B.1.351 variant of concern. If successful, this will be an important vaccine that can be scaled up rapidly and deployed throughout the world. The results of this trial will be used to assess registration of this vaccine product and will also provide crucial information to inform future generations of COVID-19 vaccines."

COVID-19 is caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (CoV) known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, which was reported to cause severe pneumonia and lethal respiratory failure. Little is known about the disease mechanism of this virus and its disease mechanism. In this application, we propose to test the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain. We will develop multiple cell-type specific mouse models that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, in a cell-type specific manner. We will then use a variety of molecular, biochemical, histological and neuroscience approaches to test the brain tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in depth and the effects of that on the central regulation of respiration. This proposal will have a transformative impact on our current understanding of COVID- 19 and its mechanisms of pathogenesis and will uncover important therapeutic targets."

ALL MAJOR ORGAN SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BE AFFECTED BY SARS-COV-2 AND COMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM ENSUING ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE MORTALITY RATE OF COVID-19. YET, DESPITE THE CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF SYSTEMIC INVOLVEMENT OF SARS-COV-2, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PATHOGENESIS OF EXTRA-PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19.

WE DEMONSTRATE THAT FOLLOWING A ROBUST ANTI-VIRAL IMMUNE RESPONSE, THERE IS METABOLIC SUPPRESSION OF OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION AND THE TRI-CARBOXYLIC ACID (TCA) CYCLE IN MULTIPLE ORGANS. THE ANIMALS DEVELOP A PROFOUND PHENOTYPE WITHIN 7 DAYS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION WITH SEVERE WEIGHT LOSS, MORBIDITY AND FAILURE TO THRIVE.

AN ORGAN WIDE METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING CONSISTENT WITH DEPRESSION OF OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION LEADS TO UTILIZATION OF PERIPHERAL FAT STORES AND GROSS ACCUMULATION OF FAT IN THE HEART, KIDNEY, LIVER AND OTHER VITAL ORGANS. WE PERFORM METABOLOMIC PROFILING OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND IDENTIFY A PANEL OF TCA CYCLE METABOLITES THAT SERVE AS BIOMARKERS OF DEPRESSED OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION, SEVERAL OF THESE MARKERS BEEN NOTED IN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE PROGNOSIS. FINALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF VIRAL GENOMES IN TISSUES, TRANSCRIPTIONAL CHANGES PERSIST AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS IN VITAL ORGANS ACROSS THE HOST CELL GENOMES. CONSIDERING THESE OBSERVATIONS, WE DISSECT THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF SUCH METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING IN SARS-COV-2.

The ability to develop vaccines, therapeutics, devices and diagnostics to prevent, treat, and identify infectious diseases is a critical public health need. Clinical trials are an integral component of these development efforts. Since the 1960s the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) have conducted trials that have evaluated promising vaccine and therapeutic candidates for infectious diseases such as influenza (including pandemic and avian influenza), malaria, tuberculosis, pneumococcal infection, in children and adults. In addition, the VTEUs have quickly launched trials in response to newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, such as the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, and Waves 1 and 5 of the H7N9 avian influenza outbreaks in China. These efforts have provided data that informed public health policy. This proposal is in response to a new VTEU structure which will involve greater collaboration between the VTEUs, NIAID, and the newly formed Leadership Group structure that are all part of the NIAID Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC). The IDCRC will enhance integration and efficiency of operations and, importantly, will foster the collaborative team science approaches now recognized as optimal to address important and complicated public health research priorities. Under the new cooperative agreement, the Kaiser Washington VTEU will continue to conduct clinical research and trials, including trials conducted under an IND or IDE, within the Kaiser Washington integrated care system to contribute to the priority research foci of NIAID. These priority areas include malaria, influenza and other respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections and include clinical trials, including human challenge models, and pharmacokinetic studies. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Seattle area infectious disease research partners who will provide scientific expertise, specialized facilities, and advanced immunologic laboratory capabilities. The Kaiser Washington VTEU will also develop and maintain surge capacity for clinical site, pharmacy and laboratory operations to enable the rapid initiation of clinical trials and other studies in response to emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats of public health importance."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,2564647,1607167,,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic of historic significance, with over 40,000 deaths from overdose in the past year. The economic costs of the epidemic in 2015 alone were estimated at over $500 billion, and in 2017 the US Department of Health and Human Services designated the opioid epidemic as a public health emergency. National-level epidemiological data indicate that the rates opioid misuse, addiction, overdose, and fatalities are increasing at a particularly fast rate among women, and among individuals in child- bearing and child-rearing age groups. Opioid-using behaviors among women who are parenting can have significant detrimental effects on their parenting, parent-child relationships, and downstream effects on child brain development, health, and subsequent risk for drug use. The lack of a strong scientific knowledge base about effective strategies for reducing opioid abuse and addiction in this population is a gap of enormous consequences given the well-established effects of substance use on parenting skills, and the known effects of maternal opioid use on infant development. The limited research on this topic that does exist suggests that family-focused treatment approaches may hold the greatest promise, but the interventions that have been developed to date have limitations in terms of scalability. In addition to a need for scientific research on this topic, there is a parallel need to make reliable information available to researchers, policy makers, and the general public. The overall goal of the Prevention Research Center: Parenting Among Women Who Are Opioid Users (PWO Center) is to improve the well-being of individuals, families, and communities affected by the opioid crisis through a focus on behavioral (parental responsivity, warmth) and neurocognitive systems (e.g., executive functioning, reward responsiveness) that are underlying mechanisms common to both addiction issues and parenting challenges. The PWO Center's Research Projects and Cores are based upon a unifying conceptual model and employ a translational science approach in which basic science investigations of underlying mechanisms are leveraged in the development and evaluation of scalable interventions that are designed to deliver population-level impacts on policy and practice. Our multidisciplinary investigative team has been conducting research on family-based parenting interventions for families with substance use histories for the past 20 years and has a long and productive history of collaboration and productivity. We have strong support for the proposed PWO Center from our state governor, our community partners, and our university leadership. The anticipated long-term, public health outcomes of the PWO Center are to improve evidence- based prevention of substance abuse, reduce maternal opioid misuse and addiction, reduce intergenerational transmission of drug addiction, increase scientific understanding and public awareness of how opioids impact maternal parenting practices via underlying behavioral and neurocognitive mechanisms, ready the next generation of researchers and practitioners in this area, and increase evidence-based policy."
3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,10005677,1598936,,"The Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) are a critical resource for the NIAID Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium to conduct clinical research and trials to evaluate vaccines, preventive biologics, therapeutics, diagnostics, predictive markers, and devices for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories. The VTEU network sites must flexible and respond to emerging threats and changing NIAID priorities. To this end, the University of Rochester VTEU (UR VTEU) will collaborate with NIAID and the VTEU leadership group (VTEU LG) to address and prioritize initiatives for infectious diseases such as respiratory, enteric, sexually transmitted infections and antibiotic resistant organisms as well as maintain flexibility to switch focus to emerging threats as the need arises. The University of Rochester is fortunate to enjoy a community with a very positive attitude towards clinical research and collaborative relationships between the major healthcare providers in the city providing access to all the hospitals, clinics and practices in the area. The UR VTEU offers a very experienced administrative and clinical group with a proven track record of successful multicenter clinical trial work. With the support of the VTEU LG, the UR VTEU will be well positioned to develop as well as implement concepts and projects that address important NIAID priorities and formulate best practices, efficiencies and standard operating procedures among VTEU sites. UR VTEU investigators have expertise in adult and pediatric clinical research as well as recruitment of vulnerable populations into clinical trials and thus can anticipate successful recruitment of young and older adults, infants, young children and adolescents, and pregnant women. Additionally, the close relationship of the Monroe County Health Department with the University provides access to patients with sexually transmitted diseases for study participation. We will provide capacity to perform phase 1-3 clinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies as well as surge capacity in terms of personnel and clinical research sites to rapidly respond to urgent NIAID demands. Importantly, our investigators have experience conducting challenge and isolation studies and can provide VTEU facilities for such projects. Our research laboratory expertise will provide the VTEU network with a variety of state of the art technologies to interrogate the host response to infection and immunization as well as develop a deeper understanding of pathogenesis for many infectious diseases. Specifically, core faculty have expertise in a wide range of novel immunologic assays as well as transcriptional and microbiome analysis. In addition, the UR VTEU will provide research opportunities and education for junior faculty to train the next generation of physician scientists. All clinical trials will adhere to NIAID/NIH requirements and comply with Good Clinical Practice. In summary, the UR VTEU site will offer an enthusiastic and diverse group of investigators with a track record of participating in collaborative research and the necessary scientific, clinical, administrative and organizational structure to support NIAID activities."

The co-Principal Investigators have conducted >30 clinical trials, most under IND; these include trials sponsored by NIAID, including VTEU contracts, HPTN and STI CTG, industry sponsors, and investigator-held IND. The proposed VTEU Research Clinic at Harborview Medical Center has been conducting clinical trials for several decades, and the recruitment, enrollment, and retention practices and policies have been well established. Our strong record in obtaining research funding has resulted in the UW School of Medicine providing ample space that has been specifically designed to accommodate clinical trials conducted in the area of Infectious Diseases. The UW VTEU will leverage the extraordinary breadth and depth of expertise, facilities, resources, populations, and geographic reach of the UW and our collaborating institutions. Locally, these include Seattle Children’s and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in addition to several campus locations for UW Medicine. Internationally, the investigators included in the UW VTEU also lead well-established and experienced research sites with outstanding infrastructure in Kenya (UW- Kenya and the Kenya Medical Research Institute), South Africa (University of Witwatersrand), and Peru (Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica). Both domestic and international investigators have vast experience in the conduct of clinical trials of vaccines and other therapeutics under IND, with many sponsored by NIAID. This consortium has demonstrated capacity to recruit and retain the populations targeted by the VTEUs, including healthy volunteers, pregnant women, children, persons with or at risk for sexually transmitted infections, and participants in human challenge studies. The Specific Aims of the UW VTEU are: 1. Recruit a wide range of participants in clinical trials approved by the Leadership Group; 2. Implement clinical trials in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and other regulatory guidance; 3. Ensure participant safety and monitor trials for adverse events; 4. Support the Leadership Group in the development of clinical protocols, providing unique clinical and research laboratory capabilities, performing data analysis, and reporting the results of clinical trials; 5. Provide outstanding training opportunities and mentorship to early stage investigators who desire to gain experience in conducting clinical trials."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,1512103,1107353,,"Project Summary/Abstract The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) has so far infected greater than 3.5 million individuals and resulted in >138,000 deaths in the US. Although it has been suggested that adaptive immunity plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes of patients infected with SARS2, protective immune responses have not been specifically defined. Also, the variability in clinical disease and outcome in patients with SARS2 infection has not been explained based on qualitative and quantitative antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, a significant proportion of children with presumed deficits in immune competence secondary to cancer chemotherapy and hematologic disorders have been observed to shed virus from the upper respiratory tract for prolonged periods of time (>4 weeks), even after complete resolution of clinical symptoms. This finding raises the possibility that specific qualitative or quantitative deficits in adaptive immune responses in some individuals can result in incomplete control of virus replication and prolonged virus shedding. Therefore, an understanding of the immune responses that lead to control of virus shedding could help define correlates of protective immunity and perhaps more importantly, determine the potential value of vaccines to limit spread of SARS2 to unvaccinated populations. The major goal of our studies is to quantify adaptive immune responses to SARS2 in a cohort of children with varying levels immune responsiveness and to relate these responses to the control of virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract, thus allowing stratification immune reactivity and control of virus replication. Defining relationships between variations in immune competence and virus shedding could provide novel insight into the level and nature of adaptive immunity, more specifically antiviral antibodies, that can restrict or eliminate viral shedding in SARS2 infected patients. Our studies will also identify SARS2 variants that arise during poorly controlled virus replication in these patients as prolonged virus replication coupled with ineffective immunity offers an ideal opportunity for the generation of viral variants. Analysis of these variants in terms of the quality and quantity of SARS2 antibody responses will help elucidate the role of SARS2 sequence variation and persistent virus replication as a mechanism for prolonged virus replication. Together, these studies will test our hypothesis that variations in immune responsiveness contribute to prolonged viral replication and shedding."

The UNC Center for Excellence in SARS-CoV2 Serologic Research uses basic and applied research strategies to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving serological and humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV2 infection. Our overall goals are to 1) characterize the immune responses elicited to SARS-CoV2 infection, 2) understand the mechanisms driving the serological, humoral and cellular immune responses, 3) determine modifiers of the serologic memory and 4) determine the serological correlates of disease pathogenesis, and protection against future infection. The program includes three Research Projects led by internationally renowned exerts in coronavirus emergence, pathogenesis and immunity (Project 1: Baric), clinical and translational mucosal and systemic immune correlates of disease (Project 2: Bartelt & Margolis) and host-pathogen interactions driving innate and serological immunity (Project 3: Wallet & Maile). Program-wide support is provided by an Administrative Core A and two Shared Resource Cores B and C. Core A includes a robust infrastructure for programmatic oversight as well as participant recruitment, sample collection, tracking and sharing (Core A: Baric & Wallet). Core B is led by world renowned experts in characterization of human antibodies in protection and pathogenesis of disease (Core B: de Silva & Lakshmanane) and will provide recombinant spike protein antigens from SARS-CoV-2 as well as antigen- specific serological assays required for accomplishing the aims of all three Research Projects. Core C is led by serological experts (Core C: Ippolitto, Georgiou & Lavinder) who have revolutionized techniques to comprehensively analyze the molecular composition of the serological antibody repertoire (IgG and IgA) and the cellular antibody repertoire (i.e. B cell receptor) and thus will delineate these repertoires in and isolate human monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2+ individuals in cohorts defined in each Research Project. All three Research Projects are integrated, and each require the support of all three Cores. To this end, Project 1 will characterize the breadth and potency of polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses as well as determine the kinetics, magnitude and durability of the type-specific and cross neutralizing responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments. Project 2 will determine the durability and the breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies and memory B-cells generated among convalescent plasma donors as well as determine the effect of convalescent plasma on the innate, adaptive and antibody repertoire in recipients. Project 3 will reveal innate immune signatures as a function of serology across the span of natural disease, as well as identify signatures which promote development of protective vs. pathogenic antibody repertoires, while delineating mechanisms of antibody mediated activation and suppression of innate immune function which drives severe vs. mild disease respectively. The integrated expertise of our Team is necessary and sufficient to address the novel cross-cutting hypotheses put forth which will improve our understanding of SARS-CoV2 serological and humoral immunity."

The Emory VTEU is supported by Emory's rich scientific milieu with numerous synergistic grants and various thematic research centers covering all IDCRC scientific priority areas. The Emory VTEU infrastructure relies on two clinical research sites with a total of 16,000 square feet of clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy space and 83 faculty members and staff. Over the past decade as a funded VTEU, we have conducted 51 VTEU protocols, served as lead on 25 trials, performed endpoint assays for 17 studies, and published 22 high impact papers. We have enrolled ~3,000 participants, 55% are female and 37% from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds with a retention rate of ~93%. With its flexible infrastructure, the Emory VTEU demonstrated surge capacity to contribute to pandemic influenza, Zika, Ebola, and biodefense efforts by prioritizing resources in funds and staffing. The Emory VTEU will build on the current surge capacity by strengthening our partnership with the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance and collaborating with well-established Emory international partners on a protocol-specific basis. Additionally, to date, our VTEU has trained 28 fellows and junior faculty. We will build on our significant record of accomplishment and advance the IDCRC mission by implementing the following specific aims: 1. Engage a broad range of Emory scientists with expertise in established and newly emerging infectious diseases in the core science of the IDCRC including concept generation and protocol development. 2. Leverage our access to a unique and diverse population and state-of-the-art research infrastructure to implement all components of the IDCRC science, including study conduct, data quality control and assurance procedures, data management, and good clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy practices. 3. Optimize our operational flexibility to further enhance our ability to provide surge capacity to address emerging infectious diseases and pandemic response. 4. Expand our mentoring capacity and enhance career development opportunities for early stage investigators in the areas of vaccinology, infectious diseases diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,Duke University,2000000,982383,,"ABSTRACT There is an urgent need to reduce disparities in COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality outcomes in historically marginalized and vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this need the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) program will support Community-Engaged Testing Research Projects and Social, Ethical and Behavioral Implications (SEBI) Research Projects to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection patterns and increase access and effectiveness of diagnostic methods in underserved and/or vulnerable populations. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), the UNC Center for Health Equity Research (CHER), and Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH) propose to serve as the Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC) to provide management, direction, and overall coordination of the RADx-UP consortium. Together, our multidisciplinary experience in project coordination; COVID-19 thought leadership; regulatory science; community engagement; health equity research; social justice; adult and child research; statistics; data science; and clinical research informatics will advance the objectives of the projects in the RADx-UP Program. Our overarching goal is to implement a community-centered approach and establish an effective, flexible, participatory, and sustainable CDCC that will serve as the infrastructure to maximize the community impact of projects in the RADx-UP Program. To achieve this vision, we will establish a program framework comprised of four cores. Our Administration and Coordination Core, in collaboration with NIH scientific staff, will facilitate the work of the RADx-UP Program in overarching administrative management. The COVID-19 Testing Core will advise and guide COVID-19 testing protocols; curate emergent testing data; and administer the Rapid Pilot Studies Program. The Community and Health System Engagement Core will support a community of practice across the RADx-UP Program; provide support in exchanging best practices across communities on recruitment, engagement, and retention of study participants; and coordinate the dissemination of study findings from RADx-UP projects. The Data Science and Biostatistics Core will manage data collection, integration, and sharing for the RADx-UP Program including merging and harmonization of multiple and diverse data sources and provide data standards, data collection design, and biostatistics consulting services. The RADx-UP CDCC goals will be met using established infrastructure and subject matter experts and will be customized to meet the variable needs of the RADx-UP community. Using the highest research standards, our team will accomplish the goals set out by the NIH in managing this critically important collaborative effort."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,3649452.31,979989,,"OVERALL ABSTRACT The overarching research theme for the Mount Sinai U54 Serological Center of Excellence “Vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Lung Cancer Based on Serological Antibody Analyses,” is to fill the vital knowledge gap in factors contributing to the great vulnerability of lung cancer patients to morbidity and mortality from SARS- CoV-2 infection through serological analysis of antibody responses and studies of inter-individual variation in patient-derived lung tumor and epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will characterize and compare lung cancer patients’ antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with a matched non- lung cancer control group; quantitate differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in lung cancer and normal lung epithelial cells from different lung cancer patients; and quantitate differences in neutralizing antibody responses in lung cancer patients. This information is urgently needed to enact vaccine and other strategies for protecting lung cancer patients against development of COVID-19. While antibodies, induced by infection or vaccines, are protective against many viruses, it has not yet been established if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are protective, how much and what types of antibody are needed for protection, and how long protection will last are unknown. Likewise, we do not know if lung cancer patients can mount an effective immune response and if different aspects of lung cancer or its treatment influences this immune response. Our overall hypothesis is that lung cancer patients have a different (e. g. weaker) antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to persons without lung cancer, and that their lung cancer or lung epithelial cells play a role in viral replication of host responses, which together could explain the aggressive course and high fatality rate demonstrated in lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Our U54 will determine whether natural infection or SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (forecast for deployment) will give comparable serological antibody responses longitudinally in 1,000 lung cancer patients and a matched non-lung cancer control group (1,000 individuals); and determine if there are differences in antibody responses related to age, gender, tobacco history, and race/ethnicity. The U54 proposal has two Projects and three Cores (Administrative, Clinical, and Data Sciences). Project 1: “Characterization of the Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Lung Cancer Patients” quantitatively characterizes anti-SARs-CoV-2 antibody responses and their functionality longitudinally in lung cancer patients compared to a control population after natural infection and vaccination, and relates the serological response characteristics to key clinical, demographic information. Project 2: “Susceptibility of Lung Cancer Cells to SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Antibody- Mediated Neutralization,” determines the inter-individual variation in lung cancers and lung epithelial cells to support SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, the inter-individual variation of antibodies to neutralize viral infection, and how these host viral responses relate to host cell characteristics and important clinical demographic information."

As of August 4, Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) has confirmed >850 cases of COVID-19 in the tribal populations served across mainly rural northeastern Oklahoma. Community spread of COVID-19 exists throughout all 14 counties in the CN reservation, but with CN’s limited capacity for community testing, screening, and contact tracing, the true impact of COVID-19 is unknown. Roughly 34% of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults aged 18-64 years are at risk of severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities, more than any other racial/ethnic group in the US. Five counties in CN are in the top 20% of US counties for the prevalence of adults at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions; this vulnerability is compounded by high poverty rates and geographic barriers. People living in rural areas of CN may have to travel as many as 60 miles round-trip for viral testing. Most COVID-19 testing in CN to date has been conducted through CNHS, the largest tribally compacted health system in the US that serves all AI/AN people living within the CN reservation. Although CNHS accounts for approximately 8.5% of all IHS active user population and 38% of active user population of Oklahoma service area, not all tribal members residing in the reservation access CNHS, and therefore, may not be tested by CNHS. Other than CNHS clinics, 7 of 14 counties in this area have only one public testing site, and results may not be returned for 2-3 weeks. CNHS and its closely integrated CN Public Health program have an exemplary 20-year record of delivering public health interventions, including a groundbreaking Hepatitis C Virus elimination program with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and ongoing projects with >40 rural K-12 schools. Through collaborative clinical research and molecular studies, CN and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation have identified new immune biomarkers in tribal populations. Drawing on these existing strengths and infrastructure, Cherokee PROTECT will (1) Build infrastructure and increase FDA-EUA COVID-19 viral and antibody testing for clinical care in CNHS; (2) Enable community-based COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and education with CN Public Health; (3) Identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing in the CN reservation to inform a tailored educational campaign to increase testing and contact tracing, and decrease spread; and (4) Implement a rigorous evaluation to ensure quality improvement and sustainability."

The Center is part of Tulane University Health Sciences along with the School of Medicine, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the School of Science and Engineering. The TNPRC is one of seven NIH-supported National Primate Research Centers within the National Primate Research Center Program. This application requests funding for the five-year time-period of May 1, 2023-April 30, 2028. Funds will be used to support administration, operations, animal resources, scientific research resources, a pilot research program, alteration and renovations, outreach, and education and training activities of the Center. The animal resources program is fully accredited by AAALAC with exemplary status. Significant infrastructure projects have been completed including renovation of new laboratory space and completion of the PET/CT facility within the RBL. We have completed a large infrastructure upgrade with upgraded boilers and new and increased capacity chillers, new building automation and access controls and energy efficiency lighting upgrades, as well as upgrades in stormwater and wastewater treatment improvements. The period since the last renewal of the TNPRC base grant has been a time of sustained growth and programmatic change. Total funding for the Center has increased to more than $43.8M in FY2021. The TNPRC is the only NPRC to have a Regional Biosafety Laboratory (BSL-3), which has been a key factor in obtaining funds to support numerous studies utilizing select agents, tuberculosis, and emerging infectious diseases, including a new and expanding program in SARS-CoV-2 research. Our efforts in SARS-CoV-2 have provided leadership within the NPRC system with the development of nonhuman primate models, testing therapeutics and vaccines. In addition, we developed a CoVID-19 Coordinating Center and Data Center supported by NIH, which provides coordinated and collaborative interactions with other NPRCs. The development of our strong Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program and new High Containment Research Performance Core have contributed greatly to our success during this funding period. In the next grant period, we will recruit additional faculty and expand our research efforts into chronic and comorbid conditions associated with infections and aging. We will focus on building onto our current successes with the generation of a new strategic plan that will make TNPRC the best primate center we can be and a premiere place to work for our employees."

The Emory VTEU is supported by Emory's rich scientific milieu with numerous synergistic grants and various thematic research centers covering all IDCRC scientific priority areas. The Emory VTEU infrastructure relies on two clinical research sites with a total of 16,000 square feet of clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy space and 83 faculty members and staff. Over the past decade as a funded VTEU, we have conducted 51 VTEU protocols, served as lead on 25 trials, performed endpoint assays for 17 studies, and published 22 high impact papers. We have enrolled ~3,000 participants, 55% are female and 37% from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds with a retention rate of ~93%. With its flexible infrastructure, the Emory VTEU demonstrated surge capacity to contribute to pandemic influenza, Zika, Ebola, and biodefense efforts by prioritizing resources in funds and staffing. The Emory VTEU will build on the current surge capacity by strengthening our partnership with the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance and collaborating with well-established Emory international partners on a protocol-specific basis. Additionally, to date, our VTEU has trained 28 fellows and junior faculty. We will build on our significant record of accomplishment and advance the IDCRC mission by implementing the following specific aims: 1. Engage a broad range of Emory scientists with expertise in established and newly emerging infectious diseases in the core science of the IDCRC including concept generation and protocol development. 2. Leverage our access to a unique and diverse population and state-of-the-art research infrastructure to implement all components of the IDCRC science, including study conduct, data quality control and assurance procedures, data management, and good clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy practices. 3. Optimize our operational flexibility to further enhance our ability to provide surge capacity to address emerging infectious diseases and pandemic response. 4. Expand our mentoring capacity and enhance career development opportunities for early stage investigators in the areas of vaccinology, infectious diseases diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention."

HOWEVER, CURRENT ENZYME-BASED METHODS LACK SENSITIVITY, SPEED, SIMPLICITY, AND REQUIRE LAB EQUIPMENTâ€”HENCE, LACK THE CAPABILITY FOR REAL-TIME POINT-OF-PRESENTATION (POP) MONITORING. IN THE ABSENCE OF A REAL-TIME POP MONITORING CAPABILITY, SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS APPLICATION, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES INNOVATIONS IN RAPID-KINETIC CHEMICAL AUTO-LIGATION, NON- ENZYMATIC ISOTHERMAL SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION, SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS, AND BIOPHOTONICS IS PROPOSED TO ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL AIR MONITORING SYSTEM (AMS) THAT DETECTS AND QUANTIFIES AEROSOLIZED SARS-COV-2 AT THE POINT OF PRESENTATION IN REAL-TIME. RECENT ADVANCES IN VIRAL CULTURING PROTOCOLS, AIR SAMPLING TECHNOLOGY, AND SINGLE-PHOTON DETECTION CAPABILITY WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH A NEW PARADIGM TO ADDRESS THE KNOWLEDGE GAP BETWEEN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND SARS-COV-2 AEROSOL TRANSMISSION. THEREFORE, THE PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE WAY COVID-19 IS CURRENTLY RESEARCHED BY PROVIDING A TOOL TO ENABLE UNPARALLELED STUDIES THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCE THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGEBASE. THESE TRANSFORMATIVE STUDIES COULD ULTIMATELY GUIDE A NEW FIELD OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF COVID-19 SPREAD, SUCH AS VIRAL EXPOSURE VS. RISK, VIRAL DECAY RATE VS. INFECTIVITY, AND VIRAL LOAD VS. INFECTIOUS DOSE IN SARS-COV-2 AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION. AT A MINIMUM, THE PROPOSED THREE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES WILL PROVIDE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF COVID-19 AEROSOL TRANSMISSION. FIRSTLY, CURRENT AIR SAMPLING SYSTEMS USE A MULTI-STEP WORKFLOW THAT TAKES SEVERAL HOURS TO COMPLETE AND REQUIRES LAB EQUIPMENT, REAGENTS, AND SIGNIFICANT HANDS-ON TIME. THE GOAL OF OBJECTIVE 1 IS TO COMBINE AIR SAMPLING AND DETECTION INTO A ONE-STEP REAL-TIME POP AMS DEVICE THAT YIELDS SARS-COV-2 QUANTIFICATION RESULTS IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES, WITHOUT LAB EQUIPMENT OR REAGENTS. SECONDLY, VIRAL INOCULUM, OR INITIAL DOSE OF VIRUS, ASPIRATED INTO THE NASAL CAVITY AND LUNGS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE ONSET AND SEVERITY. THE GOAL OF OBJECTIVE 2 IS TO OPTIMIZE AND VALIDATE AMS TO CORRELATE READINGS FROM THE AIR MONITORING DEVICE WITH TISSUE-CULTURE INFECTIOUS DOSE (TCID50) AND REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) QUANTITIES. THESE PARAMETERS CAN THEN LATER BE APPLIED TO HUMAN STUDIES TO DETERMINE THE HUMAN INFECTIOUS DOSE OF SARS-COV-2 BY AEROSOL TRANSMISSION. THIRDLY, FIELD-BASED TESTING IN HOSPITALS WILL PROVIDE A MEANS TO BETA TEST AMS PERFORMANCE IN HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS. THE GOAL OF OBJECTIVE 3 IS TO CALIBRATE AMS MEASUREMENTS WITH RT-PCR CYCLE-THRESHOLD (CT) VALUES AND CELL-CULTURE TCID50 VIABILITY RESULTS AND THEN BENCHMARK WITH RESULTS FROM HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS TAKEN FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO CORRELATE SARS-COV-2 AEROSOL CONCENTRATIONS WITH GLOBAL INFECTION RATE, AS A POTENTIAL FOR ESTABLISHING THRESHOLD LEVELS."

In addition, we will use serologic data in innovative ways to underpin mathematical models that can project population-level trends. Early serosurveys using convenience samples of the population and serologic assays with variable and often uncertain sensitivity and specificity were heavily criticized, for unrepresentativeness and inadequate accounting for test characteristics, resulting in bias and overconfidence (unduly narrow confidence bounds). Aim 1 will develop methods for valid inference of seroprevalence, specifically by (a) accounting for biased sampling, (b) accounting for imperfect tests, and (c) developing and testing a novel approach to snowball sampling employing serologic tests to enhance outbreak detection and contact tracing. Valid comparisons that assess seroprotection—whether, how much, and how long an individual is protected by an immune response to a COVID-19 infection (specifically, by antibodies) against reinfection—rely on adequate control for confounding, an issue that arises in multiple ways specific to seroprotection studies. Likewise, waning of seroprotection may be inferred in error if studies are not carefully designed and analyzed. The unprecedented efforts to develop detailed serologic and systems serologic data sets provide new forms of data that can be leveraged to better inform these inferences. Aim 2 will develop a suite of methods to enhance causal inference in seroprotection studies, including (a) sample size and power calculations; and (b) improved exploitation of serological data to reduce biases due to confounding and risk compensation. Aim 3 will develop new mathematical modeling approaches and apply them to quantify the likely reduction in the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 due to various forms of risk heterogeneity and assortativeness in mixing. Aim 4 will develop models of COVID-19 transmission that accommodate emerging evidence about the duration and nature of immunity to infection, shedding, and symptoms, to obtain estimates of how illness attack rates will differ under varying assumptions about the progress of immunity. Aim 5 will develop transmission models to assess optimal cohorting arrangements in congregate facilities (eg prisons and nursing homes), with special attention to the nature of immunity required for these arrangements to be beneficial. Finally, vaccine supplies may be initially limited, necessitating efficient use of them. Aim 6 will investigate the use of serologic data in combination with other types of data to optimize allocation of scarce vaccines."

The Center for Serological Testing to Improve Outcomes from Pandemic COVID-19 (STOP- COVID) is proposed as a transdisciplinary entity to understand the interface between exposure risk, transmission, immune responses, disease severity, protection, and barriers to testing/vaccination, with the goal of improving population health and clinical outcomes. The Center will utilize state-of-the-art serological and molecular tests, developed at OSU, in a longitudinal study of first responders, a group at continual high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, as well as their household contacts. Through the proposed work, STOP-COVID investigators will understand critical aspects of: (i) transmission in both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, (ii) immune, host, and viral determinants of disease outcome, and (iii) factors associated with immune protection. Center investigators will also identify best practices for communication of test results and information about COVID-19 to improve understanding of risk, transmission, and protection, while reducing access barriers to testing. The Center to STOP-COVID will: Aim 1 Develop Institute Infrastructure through three shared resource cores: 1. An Administrative Core that provides overall direction and leadership, coordinating all Center activities as well as Project–Core–SeroNet interactions; 2. A Testing and Biorepository Core, whose role is to perform first-tier serologic and viral testing during our longitudinal study using high throughput ELISA and neutralization assays developed at OSU, and cost-shared by OSU; and 3. A Data Management and Analysis Core that will provide project investigators with a centralized resource for biostatistics, bioinformatics, epidemiology, and psychometrics expertise. Aim 2: Conduct three innovative research projects to address: Project 1: Parallel serological and viral testing to determine COVID-19 prevalence, transmission, and protection in extended first responder cohorts. This project will also generate serology data for vaccines or mAbs, once available to this presumably high-priority group; Project 2: Serologic and molecular determinants of COVID-19 severity and immune protection. This project will evaluate COVID-19 serological responses in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold CoV (CCCoV) antibodies, using novel assays specific for a panel of antigens. Project 2 also will employ transcriptomics to understand how host genetics, CCCoV, other respiratory viruses, and immune responses contribute to pathogenesis; and Project 3: Responding to changing serological and viral information around COVID-19. This project will incorporate results from Projects 1 & 2 and SeroNet to inform best practices in risk communication, provide behavioral guidance to decrease transmission, and enhance protection from disease. Aim 3: SeroNet Participation and Sharing of Data and Best Practices. We will leverage STOP-COVID infrastructure to share data, results, reagents, and best practices with SeroNet, which will drive new discoveries and their translation into actionable strategies for implementation across all groups affected by COVID-19."

A central tenet of the Emory ACE is that unraveling the heterogeneity of human autoimmune diseases and translating that knowledge into mechanistically based treatments requires an integrated collaboration between physician-scientists, basic scientists, and expert clinicians with access to large populations of well-characterized autoimmune patients. Our fundamental goals are: (1) to understand B cell dysregulation in SLE using single cell interrogation of their molecular roadmaps, and (2) to assemble a scientific and technological platform that engages other ACE U19 and UM1 Centers through the Collaborative Project to perform similar studies in other immune cells and autoimmune disorders. These goals will be realized through a highly integrated collaboration between the three components of the Scientific Program supported by an Administrative Core. In the Principal Project, Dr. Sanz will ascertain the heterogeneity of effector B cells, their regulatory programs, and their differential utilization according to disease endotypes, and investigate the diversity and regulation of SLE memory cells. Specifically, his group will analyze germinal center dependent and independent memory and the role of antigenic persistence in the regulation of autoimmune and protective memory. In the Collaborative Project, Dr. Boss will investigate the epigenetic regulation of B cells and other immune cells in SLE and other human autoimmune diseases as part of the Collaborative Agenda that will be developed within the new ACE centers. Finally, in the Pilot Project, Dr. Scharer will pursue the functional characterization of SLE B cell differentiation using high-throughput loss-of-function and gain-of- function CRISPR screens. The Emory ACE also proposes to continue to manage the ACE Funds Management Core and to establish a centralized ACE Biorepository Core to coordinate the collection, storage, and management of samples from the Emory ACE and ACE Clinical Projects and their allocation for use in mechanistic studies. Collectively, the work proposed should contribute greatly to the charter mission and goals of the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Network."

The Center was established by the Consortia for Improving Medicine through Innovation and Technology (CIMIT), a consortium of research institutions, universities, military medicine centers and hospitals throughout the US with international affiliates at University of Manchester-UK (MIMIT), Barcelona (The Center for the Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technologies in Catalonia) and Singapore (A*-STAR/Eastern Health Alliance). CIMIT established the Point-of- Care Technology Research Center in Primary Care under a Cooperative Agreement (U54) award from National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) in 2012 and the Center created a national network of research sites, harnessing the power of multidisciplinary collaboration to speed the translation of high-impact research into primary care practice and broader dissemination by commercially licensable opportunities. We will build upon our proven approach to needs-driven primary healthcare technology innovation to expand and significantly enhance our Center. The Center’s overall objective is to build upon the progress made under the previous U54 award and offer expanded support to teams through the integrated functional elements of the proposed enhanced Center. In so doing, the Center will offer a portfolio of synergistic support to teams with innovative solutions through defined interfaces and hand offs throughout the innovation process while continuously improving the Center’s processes of finding, funding, facilitating, and following projects. The long-term goal is to create a dynamic, sustainable national network that identifies key unmet needs in the delivery of primary care as well as promising emerging technologies and then to accelerate their translation into clinical applications for broad impact in primary care medicine through high-quality translational and clinical research."

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,YALE UNIVERSITY,1933875,566332,,"Project Abstract Despite prolonged suppression of HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), eradication or sustained remission of the infection has not been achieved. Low levels of HIV DNA are still detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from people living with HIV (PWH) taking ART, and cells containing rebound-competent virus can reside in sanctuary tissue sites, including lymph nodes, gut, genital tract and the central nervous system (CNS). In a study conducted within the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, we have recently used highly sensitive virologic assays in living donors to detect HIV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells in up to 50% on long-term ART. Importantly, those with detectable CSF HIV DNA had poorer global cognitive function that those in whom CSF HIV DNA was not detected. We have subsequently shown higher concentrations of HIV DNA in CD4+ T cells from CSF compared to contemporaneous PBMC, and that atypical cell lineages including myeloid cells may be infected in CSF. Finally, we have successfully used single cell transcriptomics to identify unique and rare cell types in the CSF in PWH associated with HIV disease status and have further demonstrated the ability to identify cellular transcripts enriched in PWH versus healthy controls. Critical gaps in understanding CNS HIV persistence include what the characteristics and function of infected immune cells are in CSF, whether HIV proviruses in CSF are intact and genetically compartmentalized compared to proviruses in blood, and how these features relate to neuropsychiatric function of long-term HIV. Since the number of cells present in CSF is low in PWH suppressed on ART, thorough, simultaneous characterization of the immunologic and virologic landscape of the CNS has not been achieved. Using optimized lumbar puncture procedures and novel molecular techniques, we have overcome these obstacles to both rigorously examine the phenotype of CSF cells and thoroughly characterize the size, stability, intactness, and sequence diversity of persistent HIV in CSF compared to blood. We will use single cell technology to measure the transcriptional and cytokine profile of CNS cells combined with novel quantification of intact HIV DNA and single genome sequencing to discover new correlations within the CNS reservoir. Most importantly, we propose to rigorously examine the cognitive function and mental health of people living with HIV using sophisticated implementation of the new NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, and how differences in neuropsychiatric outcomes relate to specific immunological and virological characteristics of the CNS in a diverse cohort of participants with a range of neuropsychiatric comorbidity."

Our long- term goal is to develop a potent prophylactic pan-Coronavirus vaccine to stop/reduce past, current and future Coronavirus infections and/or diseases. While SARS-CoV-2-induced antibody and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are critical to reducing viral infection in the majority of asymptomatic individuals, an excessive proinflammatory cytokine storm appears to lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome in many symptomatic individuals. Major gaps: Identifying the epitope specificities, the phenotype and function of B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells associated with “natural protection seen in asymptomatic individuals (those who are infected, but never develop any major symptoms) should guide the development of a future coronavirus vaccine. Preliminary Results: We have made significant progress in: (A) Identifying a priori potential human B-cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell target epitopes from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome; (B) Identifying “universal” epitopes conserved and common between: (1) previous SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks, (2) current 4388 SARS-CoV-2 strains that now circulate in the United States and 184 other countries; and (3) SARS-like coronavirus strains currently found in bats that have the potential to produce future human outbreaks; (C) Applying our scalable self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs) antigen delivery platform to produce prototype multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates, that incorporate conserved protective epitopes from human and bats Coronaviruses, and demonstrated their B- and T-cell immunogenicity in HLA transgenic mice; and (D) Generating a novel “humanized” susceptible HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 triple transgenic mouse model in which to test these vaccine candidates. Our hypothesis is that one of our pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates, containing conserved “asymptomatic” SARS-CoV-2 B- and T-cell epitopes that are mainly recognized by the immune system of “protected,” asymptomatic individuals would protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease, upon intranasal delivery. To test this hypothesis our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To test in vitro the antigenicity of conserved Coronavirus epitopes, we recently identified from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome, using blood-derived antibodies, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic vs. asymptomatic individuals. The immunodominant conserved “asymptomatic” epitopes will be identified and used in our multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates. Aim 2: To test in vivo the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of highly conserved multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates, delivered mucosally, to our novel “humanized” susceptible triple transgenic mouse model. Successful completion of this preclinical vaccine project is expected to identify a broadly protective pan- Coronavirus vaccine candidate that could quickly proceed into an FDA Phase 1 clinical trial."

COVID-19 testing remains critical for tracking and slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, particularly in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and where vaccination coverage is suboptimal. The goal of this project is to expand our RADx-UP Phase 1 COVID-19 testing project Vive Sin Duda to implement and evaluate innovative implementation strategies to increase reach, access, and uptake of COVID-19 homebased self-testing (HST) among low-income Latinos in Maryland. We will implement and evaluate two COVID19 HST distribution approaches: 1) Network-based; and 2) Social marketing. We will also incorporate data driven iterative changes to optimize a community health worker (CHW)-led short message service (SMS) platform to support HST and linkage to COVID-19 care, vaccination, and other services (e.g., cash and food assistance). Primary and secondary outcomes include: 1) Reach and uptake of HST; and 2) Linkage to care for those who test positive or vaccination for unvaccinated people who test negative. Leveraging our existing community coalition, testing and vaccination clinics, and a team of bilingual and bicultural CHWs, we are well poised to implement a COVID-19 HST program and measure its impact. Our research will provide important new information that will improve access and uptake of innovative COVID-19 testing technology. It also will fill critical knowledge gaps to guide the translation of evidence-based interventions into widespread adoption by RADx-UP consortium members."

The agreement will end on August 31, 2019. CDC and WHO initiated these cooperative agreements in 1995 as an outgrowth of previous collaborations and as part of the CDC strategy to address emerging infectious diseases. Over the years, these agreements have served as broad-scope umbrella agreements under which a wide variety of projects addressing emerging infectious diseases may be undertaken collaboratively. On September 19, 2011, the Government of the United States of America and the World Health Organization signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to assist WHO Member States in strengthening their capacity to meet the requirements of the International Health Regulations (2005). The MOU encourages CDC and WHO to pursue activities that improve the abilities of all nations to detect, report, and respond to infectious diseases quickly and effectively. CDC program managers, WHO administrators, and national health authorities agree that the activities funded under the current agreement have supported the purposes of the MOU, strengthened overall infectious disease surveillance and response, improved national public health infrastructure, and provided critical technical assistance in support of global health security. This FOA serves to renew and extend this mutually beneficial partnership. The Core Component “Component 1: Core Activities” and central to this ongoing relationship, the CDC and the programs now within the WHO Health Emergencies Program (WHE) have worked together for decades across the globe to prevent, prepare for, detect, and respond to outbreaks and other emergencies with health consequences. While WHE and CDC have collaborated on numerous activities, greater overall institutional guidance and prioritization will provide coherent direction based on the five strategic objectives below: 1. Enhance global surveillance, early warning, risk investigation and assessment; 2. Advance the prevention and control of epidemic-prone diseases; 3. Support countries to implement the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (MEF) and develop National Action Plans; 4. Strengthen country capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to emergencies and outbreaks, informed as appropriate by the results of the IHR (2005) MEF; and 5. Coordinate and contribute to the response to disease outbreaks and other emergencies with health consequences. A second component “ Component 2: Rapid Response to Highly Infectious Disease Outbreaks”of this funding opportunity is to ensure expanded collaboration between CDC and WHO in relation to emergency outbreaks with an ability to respond rapidly on short notice to be available to:• Assure rapid detection and response and safe handling of patients or specimens suspected of being infected with highly infectious diseases/agents.• Strengthen WHO emergency and preparedness and response capabilities.• Strengthen and fill gaps in ongoing public health infrastructure and programs. • Increase security and logistics for local responders"

3/23/2025,Department of Health and Human Services,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,2652785.13,477912,,"ASBTRACT Overview Every day, Californians continue to experience high levels of exposure to the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. There is an ever-growing urgent need to better understand the nature of exposures, course of illness and recovery, and potential for immunity among persons at particularly heightened risk for the worst COVID-19 outcomes. As part of a rapid scientific response to the present public health crisis, we convened on March 18, 2020 a collaborative of frontline clinicians and scientists to form the Coronavirus Risk Associations and Longitudinal Evaluation (CORALE) studies (corale-study.org). We established two base study cohorts with enrollment centered on (i) patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 treated in our health system (currently N>8,300) and on (ii) healthcare workers directly or indirectly involved in delivering their care (currently N=6,679). In response to NIH RFA-CA-20-038, we are now highly motivated and prepared to leverage our existing infrastructure to directly address the critical need for comprehensive longitudinal data collection and analyses to advanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 risks, the course of disease, the nature of recovery, and the potential for immunity across populations at risk. By establishing the CORALE-SeroNet U54 program, our goal will be to form a robust and sustainable structure of academic activities centered on investigating the responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 exposure and the extent to which carefully phenotyped clinical and molecular profiles can signal robust immune reconstitution and complete functional recovery. Our study will be centered on the ethnically/racially diverse population served by our health system in Los Angeles, given then critical need for more knowledge regarding the determinants of COVID-19 related risks in these minority subgroups. Our scientific objectives will be achieved by an outstanding collaborative team of clinician-scientists, epidemiologists, immunologists, basic and translational scientists, analytical chemists, and biostatisticians. Leveraging our collective experience, resources, and infrastructure at major academic institutions from across Southern California (Cedars Sinai, UCSD, UCLA, and USC), we will advance the scientific enterprise through the three distinct yet closely integrated research Projects: Project 1 will elucidate the natural history and longitudinal trajectories that represent the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, infection, recovery, and clinical immunity patterns across the spectrum of persons at risk. Project 2 will investigate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 response in persons with altered innate immune function, with a focus on individuals with pre-infection susceptibility traits (e.g. metabolic disease states); and, Project 3 will investigate the determinants of SARS- CoV-2 response in persons with altered adaptive immune function, with a focus on individuals with immune- altered status arising from select malignancies, autoimmune disease, and/or their directed therapies. As a whole this research program will integrate population, clinical, translational, and basic science resources with a world- class investigator team to meet the urgent need for new mechanistic insights and therapeutic approaches to address key knowledge gaps regarding SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and potential for immunity."
