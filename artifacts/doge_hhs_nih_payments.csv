The main objective of the PROMINENT project is to identify the mechanisms that control mutant cells within normal human tissues, and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cancer promoting agents stimulate the conversion of these cells to neoplastic growth. We are one of the teams involved in that project, leading the WP5: Deriving molecular signatures of cancer promotion.

We are using ultradeep sequencing and a set of computational tools developed de novo or adapted for their use of this new type of data to probe the clonal landscape of several normal tissues across individuals with different histories of exposures and lifetime cancer risk.

The requested funds cover i) the recruitment of several Postdoctoral Researchers and Technicians, ii) experimental tasks related with ultradeep sequencing library preparation (specifically to acquire laboratory supplies and cover sequencing services), and iii) publication of results. These funds are thus key to fulfill the identification of molecular signatures of cancer promotion that WP5 is tasked for within the PROMINENT project.","NIH approves the payment for OCA278668A in line with the terms and conditions of the Notice of Award, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E—Cost Principles, and the NIH Grants Policy Statement 7.9—Allowability of Costs/Activities.

The $306,569.41 is a culmination of costs already absorbed by the company in the period in which we were not able to draw from the grant. The grant funds were finally released last week for us to draw from, thus the large sum all at once.

$88,832 in personnel labor costs.

$90,000 in equipment purchases (high pressure pumping systems).

$74,406.26 in materials and supplies purchases (Chemical solvents & test cmpds, column preparation materials, cartridge electronic components & boards, detector optics & housings, solid phase extraction materials)

- Emmanuel Darcq, senior scientist at INSERM. His contribution to the project helped him to get a permanent position at INSERM and will help him towards independence for his future career. He presented some of the work presented at symposiums some of the work at the International narcotic research conference (July 2024), the addiction Gordon Research Conference and chair a session (August 2024), at the European winter brain conference (EWCBR, January 2025) and co-organized an EMBO global lecture at Mohali India (March 2025). He has gradually taken the lead on this project. He will also present his work at the Mediterranean Neuroscience Conference (June 2025) and International narcotic research conference (July 2025).
 
- Dersu Ozdemir, International Master student from Paris, joined our laboratory and the UNISTRA in march 2021 to start her PhD. She works full time on this project and has established the animal model to study the role of habenular MOR neurons on Naloxone responses in naïve and dependent animals. Now, she is working on fiber photometry and chemogenetic experiments to finalize her work. She obtained a first author paper in Scientific reports and presented her work at ECNP 2024 in September. She defended her PhD in March 2025 and this phase is critical to the development of her future career, as she wish to pursue with a postdoctoral position. She will also present her work at the International narcotic research conference (July 2025).
 
- Chiara Ebner, International Master student from Ulm in Germany, joined our laboratory and the UNISTRA in January 2024 to start her PhD. She works full time on the characterization of habenular MOR neurons to determine whether medial and lateral habenular MOR-expressing neurons have different physiological roles or represent a unique functionally defined cross-habenular neuronal population modulating affective states. She recently used spatial transcriptomic to determine specific neuronal population of habenular neurons. She will also present her work at the International narcotic research conference (July 2025).
 
- Gabriele Giua, a recent PhD from Marseille, France (Lab of Dr Olivier Manzoni), has joined our laboratory in April 2024 as postdoctoral fellow to work on MOR neurons manipulation and calcium-activity characterization using fiber photometry. He is taking over on-going work from Dersu Ozdemir (contract will finish at the end of June 2025) on habenula projections, with a focus on LH. He will also present his work at the International narcotic research conference (July 2025).
 
- Judith Meyer, research assistant and mouse manager, joined our team in September 2023. She is in charge of all mutant mouse colonies of our lab and dedicates a large part of her time to this project. This training will help her develop as a project manager in the future, with the goal to obtain a permanent position.

04/25/2025,200000,HHS-NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,Not available,,"Responding to this office’s request to provide additional information on the disbursement of funds from the NIH/NIDDK grant - FAIN: RDK135218A, titled: “New approach for immune modulation against T1D.” As noted in your email:  “An ideal payment justification includes a specific description of: a) what the funds are for, b) why the funds are necessary, and c) why they are aligned with the award.”

A)	 What are the funds for?
The development of an effective treatment for Type 1 diabetes. A severe and costly disease that currently has no cure. Specifically, Research materials and supplies for the manufacture of EVOQ’s breakthrough NanoDisc technology for T1D, equipment and laboratory facility expenses, animal models, samples derived from T1D patients, and Research personnel.

B)	 Why are the funds necessary?
EVOQ is a small Biotech company with limited capital and resources. These funds support the T1D research and development plan outlined in the grant budget. Expense categories include Research materials and supplies for the manufacture of EVOQ’s breakthrough technology, equipment and laboratory facility expenses, animal models, samples derived from T1D patients, and Research personnel. As also noted in the grant, there is a huge unmet need for effective treatments for diabetes – a severe and costly disease with no cure. Some key facts: Nearly 40 million Americans, or 12% of the population, have diabetes. Two (2) million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, including about 304,000 children and adolescents. Because there is no cure, $413 billion was spent on diabetes in the United States in 2022. In addition, Diabetes is a leading cause of death in the United States, with the incidence of Type 1 diabetes is growing 3.5 times faster than the population (2.9% per year, vs. 0.8% per year)

C)	 Why are the funds aligned with the award?
These funds directly align with the award budget categories outlined in the grant. They include Research personnel, Laboratory personnel, necessary equipment, T1D-related materials and supplies, and laboratory facility expenses.

04/25/2025,108237.92,HHS-NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,Not available,,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents an urgent and growing public health crisis in the United States, with profound consequences for patients, caregivers, and the national economy. As the population ages, the financial burden of AD is projected to exceed $1 trillion annually—an estimate that does not fully capture the immense personal suffering and societal impact. Without intensified research efforts, both the human and economic toll will continue to escalate.
The spent funds were used to drive a critical research project at the Burke Neurological Institute (BNI), aimed at uncovering the underlying mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, the project investigates early dysfunction in neuronal activity and protein quality control systems within key brain regions, such as the locus coeruleus and hippocampus. By exploring the role of factors like sleep disturbances in these processes, the research seeks to identify early biomarkers and actionable targets for therapeutic intervention.
The requested spent funds were essential to enable the successful execution of this high-priority research at BNI. These expenses were aligned with the budget that was allocated to support core project components as follows:
•	Personnel: Funding supported a dedicated team of researchers, including the Contact Principal Investigator, a postdoctoral scientist, a wet lab research staff and two computational research scientists with specialized expertise in in vivo electrophysiology, behavioral analysis, advanced molecular techniques, and computational neuroscience. Their skills are critical to the project’s rigorous experimental design.
•	Equipment and Materials: The project funds were also spent for supplies required to operate state-of-the-art instrumentation and laboratory resources housed at BNI. These included advanced electrophysiology systems, surgical equipment, and specialized biological and chemical reagents that were essential for conducting the proposed experiments.
•	Operational Expenses: Funding also covered operational costs, including the care and maintenance of in vivo models, travel for scientific collaboration and dissemination of results, and data management infrastructure aligned with NIH FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles.
BNI’s research is at the leading edge of AD investigation, utilizing innovative methodologies and disease-relevant models to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The anticipated outcomes have the potential to inform earlier diagnosis and facilitate the development of urgently needed treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
The resources expended as well as future monies for this research represents a strategic and necessary step in addressing the mounting challenges posed by Alzheimer’s disease. The expenditures were not only justified—but were pivotal to advancing the science that may ultimately reduce the burden of this devastating condition. The successful execution of this project is directly contingent upon past and future use of these funds. We are aligned with and thank you for the outstanding work you are doing to assure that research dollars are being spent in a way that is consonant with the optimal future personal and financial health of the country.

Adiponectin is a protein that circulates in high levels in the blood and which has known protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Aging impairs vascular function, but late-life exercise can reverse much of the vascular dysfunction related to advancing age.
