Advertising/marketing materials such as ""Enroll Alabama"" branded tote bags, pens, hand sanitizers, billboard signs and informational brochures serve a functional purpose by enhancing visibility and awareness of the program, plus help attract community members to our booths and website or the Health Insurance Marketplace.
Moreover, these items help reinforce key messages about enrollment deadlines, the value of coverage, and the availability of free, unbiased assistance. This is especially important in communities with lower digital access or limited exposure to online marketing.
These tools directly support our program’s goals to educate consumers, raise awareness about coverage options, and to increase enrollment.
