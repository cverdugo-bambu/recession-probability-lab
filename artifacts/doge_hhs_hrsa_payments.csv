These clinical fellows and residents receive critical education and training in over 40 clinical departments and 258 specialized clinical programs, including in Cardiology, Neurology, Sports Medicine, Orthopedics, Gastroenterology, Radiology, Emergency Medicine, and in many other areas where there are physician shortages. Our trainees are engaged in and responsible for the care of children that ranges from primary care to the management of medically complex and chronic health conditions.
The Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education funds BCH receives helps defray the costs of the essential education and training for these physician trainees participating in the BCH graduate medical education programs. It is the only source of government funding received by Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) for the training of pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists. On an annual basis, CHGME funding received by BCH subsidizes approximately one third of the total training costs incurred by the institution.
Funding received through the CHGME program is critical to BCH’s ability to continue to offer effective and high-quality training in pediatrics and pediatric subspecialties. These funds allow BCH to pay for a portion of program administration costs, educational tools and educational offerings and help provide support for residents and clinical fellows while they participate in clinical care, including through salaries, stipends and benefits costs. The CHGME program operates on a reimbursement methodology, as opposed to prospective payment, meaning that Boston Children’s funds must be expended before payments can be invoiced and received from HRSA. These dollars fund the training of the next generation of pediatric health professionals and is critical in the health care delivery of complex, sick and vulnerable children. Many of our trainees go on to practice medicine in other parts of the country, where pediatric provider shortages are especially pronounced.

05/05/2025,1730339.57,HHS-HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION,Not available,,"The request for payment is made pursuant to Award from the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to Southeast Missouri State University (SEMO). The statutory authority for the $10,000,000 award per SEMO’s 
What the Award is for:
SEMO’s Community Project Funding/Congressional Directed Spending (CPF/CDS) project will construct a new, multi-story, approximate 54,608-sf Health Sciences Building on an existing site owned by the SEMO in Cape Girardeau, MO. The building will include new classrooms, laboratories, clinical and other and experiential learning space, shared use facilities, and meeting venues to build and sustain the health care workforce. 

Why is the Project Necessary:
Pursuant to the project narrative submitted to HRSA as part of the grant making process, the Health Sciences Building will meet programmatic needs and expectations for students and faculty, and provide space for SEMO to enhance preprofessional and other training programs to meet existing and projected health workforce needs in Missouri and across the United States.  

The Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC) projects that many of the programs that will be served by the Health Sciences Building will experience employment growth in Missouri between now and 2028. For example, dietitians and nutritionists (10.14% growth), food scientists and technologists (4.47%), physical therapists (18.87%), registered nurses (16.24%) and physiologists (10.7%), among other fields and areas of study. Overall, MERIC data project that Healthcare Support Occupations will grow by 12.77% and Healthcare Practitioners and Technical Occupation by 13.08% between now and 2028. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects similar growth at the national level over the next decade. The Health Sciences Building will allow SEMO to help meet these workforce needs. 

Many of the academic programs that will be served by the new Health Sciences Building are currently located in other facilities at SEMO that are experiencing significant structural and mechanical failures. Construction of the new Health Sciences Building will address these deficiencies while also ensuring SEMO continues to meet the programmatic needs and expectations for students, faculty, and current healthcare professionals.
 
The population groups to be served by the project include but may not be limited to: (1) students attending SEMO seeking to pursue a career in a STEM, health and life sciences, or allied health field; (2) practicing professional seeking continuing education and professional development or opportunities to engage with faculty or students in academic or research endeavors; and (3) members of the community that will benefit from a trained healthcare workforce.

If the Health Sciences Building is not constructed, the existing deficiencies and inadequacies of the current learning environment would continue, and SEMO’s ability to train and prepare the healthcare workforce would be significantly hindered. This would further impact the City of Cape Girardeau, the southeast Missouri region, and the State of Missouri, all of which are currently struggling to maintain adequate levels of staffing across many health-related occupations.

Tracking Number: PA-00138246
Grant Number:CE1HS54340

TO: Department of Health and Human Services - Health Resource and Services Administration (HRSA)
FROM: The Richland Hospital, INC (TRH) (Award Number 6 CE1HS54340-01-05)
SUBJECT: Approval to Draw-Down Funds

The Federal Award Date for Grant Number CE1HS54340 (Richland Hospital & Clinics Community Project Funding/ Congressionally Directed Spending - Construction) was 09/23/2024.  Per THR’s NOA, the Project Period’s start date was 09/30/2024 with an ending date of 09/29/2027.  Approval to proceed with construction was received on 1/22/2025.

The Richland Hospital and Clinics is a community-sponsored, nonprofit, integrated primary care and specialty care clinic and critical access hospital, governed by a Board of Directors who oversee our activities, financial health and sustainability. Initially, the Board and Executive Management Team (EMT) discussed using CPF/CDS funding with our congressional representatives for a replacement facility. However, our plan has changed to renovating the current facility due to the increase in construction and material costs and not being able to design a building that would meet patient and staff needs while staying within budget. This change was relayed to our representatives to ensure that we would still meet CPF/CDS funding eligibility.

TRH’s BOD and Hospital Management based the scope of the project on the “Must Dos” list developed during the planning stage in early 2024. These projects will require coordination between multiple disciplines but tend to focus on individual types of projects throughout the interior and at the exterior of the building. Hospital leadership was highly focused on maintaining existing structures and took great pride in being good stewards of our resources, avoiding unnecessary duplication while identifying community needs. This project reconfirms the commitment Richland Hospital made to our community in 1924 as Richland County’s only hospital. Our future is built on creating a sustainable facility centered on the health and well-being of patients, which will meet our community’s current and future needs.

All costs requested for reimbursement, including pre-award costs were previously represented in the submitted proposal as well as the approved budget updates to HRSA These costs represent proper Project Costs and were necessary to complete all required components of the submittal process to access the awarded congressionally directed spending and are required in order to complete the construction associated with this project. The monies requested hereby are not greater than those necessary to meet obligations due and payable for Project Costs and do not include retention of monies not yet due under construction contracts.

The following submitted construction costs were incurred after receiving the NOA, granting approval to proceed with construction. The expenditures for which monies are requested hereby represent proper Project Costs, have not been included in a previous Requisition Certificate and have been properly recorded on TRH’s books.

A Community-Based Solution That Saves Money and Strengthens Alaska

Overview
A Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Loan Locker provides free, short-term access to essential medical equipment like wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, and shower chairs. This program is a cost-effective, community-driven solution that addresses major gaps in Alaska’s healthcare system — especially in remote and rural areas.

It empowers local residents, reduces emergency response strain, and keeps people safe at home, all while saving taxpayer money and extending the life of valuable equipment.

1. Alaska’s Equipment Access Crisis
In Alaska, getting medical equipment isn’t a matter of days it’s often a matter of months.

Shipping Delays: Most DME comes from out of state. Due to long shipping routes, weather issues, and limited freight options, even basic equipment can take 2 to 8 weeks to arrive. In off-road or remote communities, it can take longer — sometimes 2 to 3 months.

Insurance Bottlenecks: Even with coverage, people wait 4 to 6 weeks for doctor approvals, insurance authorizations, and supplier coordination before shipping begins.

Limited Local Supply: Outside of Anchorage and Fairbanks, there are few DME providers. For many, the only option is to travel or go without putting them at risk of injury or hospitalization.

2. A Smarter Way to Support Alaskans
A DME Loan Locker changes the game by making equipment available immediately — no shipping, no red tape. Local nonprofits or community health organizations can manage the lockers, sanitizing and reissuing donated or lightly-used equipment.

This model:

Reduces costs for families and healthcare systems

Keeps seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities safe at home

Prevents unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital readmissions

Fosters a self-reliant, sustainable approach to rural health care

3. Easing the Load on Emergency and Public Resources
Without proper equipment, people often rely on emergency services for basic needs:

911 calls for help with mobility or falls

Emergency room visits for injuries that could have been prevented

Fire departments asked to assist with lifting or home safety checks

These situations are avoidable. Providing walkers, shower chairs, and safety tools reduces these calls and lets our first responders focus on true emergencies. A DME Loan Locker is a practical, efficient solution that saves lives and resources.

4. Supporting Veterans, Seniors, and Working Families
This program directly benefits those who have given so much:

Veterans who deserve access to mobility and independence

Seniors aging in place with dignity

Low-income families facing medical emergencies with no support

Rural residents who live hours from the nearest equipment provider

It’s about helping people help themselves — without handouts, without expanding government, and without adding costs to the system.

5. A Program That Pays for Itself
Most of the equipment in a Loan Locker can be:

Donated by hospitals, families, or the VA

Refurbished, sanitized, and reused multiple times

Distributed quickly and locally

It’s a one-time infrastructure investment with long-term payoff. It reduces Medicaid and Medicare spending, hospital burden, and emergency room overload — while building a culture of community care and common sense.

Conclusion: A Proven, Conservative Solution for Alaska
The DME Loan Locker is exactly the kind of project that works in Alaska:

Locally managed

Low cost, high impact

Efficient, sustainable, and people-focused

It’s not about more government, it’s about smarter government. It’s a win for public health, emergency readiness, and taxpayer dollars.

Support for this initiative is support for Alaska families, veterans, and first responders. It’s the kind of solution that works for real Americans, and keeps Alaska strong.

Program Overview
This HRSA-funded initiative supports the training of Community Health Workers (CHWs) who will serve individuals with disabilities in rural communities across Tennessee. The program addresses workforce shortages by preparing local residents for entry-level healthcare roles that support care coordination, resource navigation, and health promotion.

The training model emphasizes practical skills, field experience, and regional service alignment. Participants are recruited from rural counties and complete short-term, certificate-based training through Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology (TCATs) and community colleges. The program is designed to be time-limited and goal-oriented, with clear milestones to encourage timely completion.

Expense Breakdown and Justification

Expense Category	Amount	Justification
Participant Stipends	$219,000.00	Issued directly to learners as financial support during training and to incentivize program completion. Stipends help offset costs such as transportation, childcare, and time away from work.
Salary	$45,469.02	Covers the wages of the program coordinator and specialist who provide daily program oversight, manage student support services, and monitor progress. The project manager’s salary is not charged to this grant.
Admin Fees	$30,888.00	Paid to a third-party fiscal vendor responsible for processing individual stipend checks, issuing tax forms (e.g., 1099s), and ensuring proper documentation of payments.

Tuition	$16,100.00	Payment of tuition and fees for learners enrolled in approved training programs at TCATs and community colleges.
Conclusion
The total requested reimbursement of $325,209.68 reflects allowable, documented expenses in support of a targeted health workforce initiative. All costs align with the approved budget narrative and serve the grant’s objective of preparing individuals in rural areas to support healthcare access for people with disabilities. This submission does not include any personnel costs for the project manager, and all stipend payments and administrative functions were managed through a contracted third party to ensure accuracy and compliance.

04/24/2025,65011,HHS-HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION,Not available,,"Payment Justification Summary for Ryan White Part C EIS Funds (March 2025):

The March 2025 allocation of Ryan White Part C EIS funds was strategically utilized to advance the program’s mission of reducing HIV disparities in the South and Central Bronx, with a focus on the high-need communities and zip codes specified in the NOFO. These funds supported both Personnel Services (PS) and Other Than Personnel Services (OTPS), ensuring the delivery of comprehensive, equitable care while adhering to federal guidelines and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative’s priorities.

Personnel Services (PS) were critical to maintaining a skilled workforce dedicated to direct service delivery and program operations. Clinical staff, including infectious disease specialists, provided essential HIV care such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) management, viral load monitoring, and telehealth consultations for patients facing mobility or transportation challenges. Outreach workers and linkage-to-care coordinators conducted community-based testing initiatives in neighborhoods like Hunts Point-Morrisania and Crotona-Tremont, ensuring timely diagnosis and connection to care for marginalized populations, including Black and Latinx communities, and people who inject drugs. Case managers addressed social determinants of health by securing housing resources, food assistance, and benefits enrollment for vulnerable patients, while mental health counselors offered trauma-informed support in collaboration with local organizations. Administrative personnel ensured compliance with HRSA reporting requirements, tracked outcomes, and coordinated logistics, maintaining the program’s operational integrity.

Other Than Personnel Services (OTPS) covered the operational and programmatic expenses necessary to sustain and enhance service delivery. Rapid HIV testing kits, viral load lab services, and ART to support early diagnosis and treatment initiation. Transportation assistance, including MetroCards, reduced barriers to clinic attendance for residents of transit-limited areas like Fordham-Bronx Park. Partnerships with community-based organizations such as BronxWorks and Urban Health Plan expanded access to housing support, food pantries, and harm reduction services, amplifying the program’s reach. Competency training for staff ensured services were delivered in a linguistically and culturally responsive manner to diverse populations, including those with limited English proficiency.

The synergy between PS and OTPS was pivotal to the program’s success. For example, outreach workers (PS) utilized public transportation – staff travel (OTPS) to engage hard-to-reach populations, while case managers (PS) leveraged transportation MetroCard (OTPS) to retain patients in care. Together, these investments ensured continuity of services, strengthened patient-provider relationships, and advanced measurable outcomes such as timely linkage-to-care and improved retention rates.

All expenditures adhered strictly to Ryan White Part C EIS guidelines (CFDA 93.918) and the NOFO’s scope of work. PS costs were validated through timesheets and role-specific job descriptions, while OTPS expenses were documented via invoices, service agreements, and procurement records. These investments not only complied with federal requirements but also reinforced the program’s commitment to health equity, community collaboration, and sustainable care models in one of the nation’s most underserved regions.",This payment request has been reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable federal regulations and the terms of the award.,BRONXCARE HEALTH SYSTEM,

Personnel and Fringe Benefit Costs – 

Personnel and fringe benefit costs are essential to implementing and sustaining the Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT) model in Colorado. Illuminate Colorado is responsible for launching and supporting SBCT implementation across four established sites and securing the required fifth site to meet statewide program objectives. To achieve this, dedicated staff are necessary to provide direct support to each site, including site coordination, fidelity monitoring, technical assistance, and facilitation of collaborative cross-system partnerships.

In addition to local site implementation, funding supports critical state-level coordination to ensure alignment with national SBCT standards, consistent quality assurance, and robust interagency collaboration. Staff funded under this budget provide technical assistance and consultation to site-based stakeholders, participate in strategic planning, and facilitate the Active Community Team and State Advisory Board.

To ensure the continuity and integrity of programmatic delivery and administration, supportive staff were leveraged across the organization. This includes personnel in data and evaluation to track outcomes and support continuous improvement, communications staff to manage stakeholder engagement and dissemination efforts, education team members to develop and deliver SBCT training content, policy staff to align the SBCT model with statewide systems-change initiatives, and finance and operations staff to manage budgeting, compliance, and reporting responsibilities.

The allocation of personnel and fringe benefit costs reflects a comprehensive and integrated approach to implementing the Safe Babies Court Team model with fidelity, while maintaining accountability, sustainability, and statewide coordination.

Travel - 

Travel is a necessary and allowable cost to support the implementation, evaluation, and statewide coordination of the Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT) model across Colorado. As this project involves active engagement with multiple judicial districts and community partners, in-person travel is required to establish and support site-level implementation, provide technical assistance, facilitate cross-agency collaboration, and conduct fidelity and quality assurance activities.

Travel costs will cover mileage, lodging, per diem, and other allowable expenses for staff and contractors traveling to SBCT sites—including four currently active sites and a fifth site in development. Site visits are critical for building relationships, conducting training and coaching, facilitating collaborative team meetings, and ensuring alignment with SBCT core components.

Additionally, travel supports participation in statewide meetings, learning communities, and evaluation planning sessions, including visits to partner organizations such as the Kempe Center, court systems, and child welfare agencies. Participation in national-level peer learning opportunities and convenings ensures Colorado’s implementation remains aligned with best practices and emerging evidence from the broader SBCT community.

Overall, travel supports the effectiveness, responsiveness, and sustainability of the SBCT model across diverse geographic regions in Colorado and contributes to stronger outcomes for infants, toddlers, and families served by the program.","•	This payment request has been reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable federal regulations and the terms of the award.

04/29/2025,34419.62,HHS-HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION,Not available,,"Cancer Prevention Services Program Overview
Ellenville Regional Hospital was awarded a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to establish a Cancer Prevention Services Program. This initiative addresses the critical need to reduce the disproportionately high rates of late-stage cancer diagnoses in the rural communities of Wawarsing and its surrounding areas.
The program’s primary objective is to improve compliance with national cancer screening guidelines, thereby lessening the impact and severity of advanced cancer cases. The region faces several significant challenges, including persistent poverty, inadequate access to healthcare, and systemic barriers that hinder the receipt of timely and effective medical services. These factors contribute to heightened cancer disparities and overall poorer health outcomes.
The service area consists of geographically isolated and resource-limited communities that struggle with socioeconomic hardships. These challenges create considerable obstacles to accessing and utilizing preventive screenings such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans.
To combat these issues, a comprehensive work plan was developed and implemented with the following goals:
•	Integrate the Cancer Prevention Services Program into the existing Rural Health Wellness Workgroup.
•	Increase the number of mammograms, colonoscopies, and LDCT scans completed according to recommended screening guidelines.
•	Promote cancer prevention through community education, outreach efforts, and individual coaching.
•	Provide nutrition education and personalized coaching to support healthier lifestyles.
•	Expand tobacco cessation programming as a key cancer prevention strategy.
These goals are being accomplished through evidence-based interventions that engage both healthcare providers and community members.
Expenditures: February and March 2025
During this reporting period, program expenditures were allocated as follows:
Salary and Fringe Benefits
•	Project Director: Oversight of program implementation, supervision of personnel, and monitoring of performance metrics.
•	Project Coordinator: Ensured timely achievement of work plan milestones and supported the Community Health Worker, including facilitating workshops on cancer prevention and nutrition.
•	Community Health Worker: Conducted direct outreach, cancer screening education, and provided one-on-one nutrition coaching.
Contractor Payments
•	Payments were made to The Institute for Family Health for services rendered by the Care Navigator, Supervisor, and Director. The Care Navigator focused on patient outreach and education around cancer screenings within primary care settings, thereby extending the program’s reach.
Travel and Mileage
•	Covered local travel for staff conducting community engagement activities, including client visits, workshops, and flyer distribution.
•	Included travel costs for the Project Director and Coordinator to attend the Annual Grantee Meeting and Conference held at the Georgia Tech Conference Center in Atlanta. This event provided valuable networking opportunities and exposure to best practices in the field.
Other Expenditures
•	Procurement of a work-issued mobile phone for the Community Health Worker.
•	Reimbursement stipend for the coordinator’s use of a personal phone for official duties.
•	Purchase of outreach and marketing materials through VistaPrint.
•	Acquisition of health and wellness journals to support health coaching sessions.

04/24/2025,10996.27,HHS-HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION,Not available,,"This draw down is aligned with Grant H8NCS54189‐01‐00.  Spending on salaries and fringe benefits is fully aligned with the grant agreement and is in scope to achieve project objectives of increasing the number of patients who receive mental health services, as well as increasing the number of patients who receive substance use disorder (SUD) services, including medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD).”
Mental health disorders are a significant public health problem, both in their own right and because they are often associated with many other chronic diseases. Untreated disorders may leave individuals at risk for substance abuse and other self-destructive behavior. Additionally, mental health disorders can have a serious impact on physical health and are associated with the prevalence, progression, and outcome of chronic diseases. The effects of mental illness range from minor disruptions in daily functioning to incapacitating personal, social, and occupational impairments and early death.
Notably, Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles’ 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment highlighted mental health as a growing critical health challenge in LA County and throughout California. Over a quarter of teens (27.5%) in LA County reported needing help with mental or emotional issues with the highest need in Service Provision Area (SPA) 4 with this need rising to 70% of youth in the juvenile justice system. According to SAMSHA, 73.1% of children receiving mental health treatment had a serious emotional disturbance and 74.2% of adults had a serious mental illness.
Relatedly, substance use disorders are highly correlated with high rates of mental health conditions. In 2022, the LA County Department of Public Health found that the estimated population of residents 12 years of age or older1 in need of SUD treatment was over 17%. This translates to over 1.4 million people in LA County alone. More broadly, only 1% of health center patients are using SUD services vs the estimate of 17% who could use this help, with the real rate of need being almost certainly higher.
Even amongst children the rates are high: nearly 7% of children 12 and older in SPA 4 of Los Angeles County were already misusing pain relievers. In LA County, there are approximately 3,000 alcohol and drug related deaths every year, and nearly 148,000 annual alcohol or other drug (AOD)-related emergency room visits. In SPA 4 of LA County, 8.2 percent of service area residents (age 12+) reported dependence or abuse of illicit drugs or alcohol in the past year, a rate that is likely far higher if under-reporting is taken into account.
Alarmingly, data from the California Department of Public Health show that fentanyl-related deaths have increased exponentially over the last 10 years — and have more than tripled since only 2019. The increase is so significant, that in 2012, data show that 82 fentanyl-related deaths were reported to the department. By 2019, the number grew to 1,603 — before exploding to 5,722 in 2021.
Clearly, there are high rates of mental health disorders and SUDs in Los Angeles County and more resources are required to address these conditions.
STAFF Spending – 
MD Doctor – Providing SUD treatment and training to other physicians on addiction counseling. 
Director of Behavioral Health  – overseeing the program staff in behavioral health/ program design and oversight
