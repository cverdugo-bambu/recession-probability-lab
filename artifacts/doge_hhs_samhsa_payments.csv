 OMRI (Opioid Multi-Agency Response Initiative) serves all patients in the prehospital setting of 911 response within Contra Costa County who are experiencing suspected opioid overdose or opioid withdrawal symptoms.
 OMRI is a collaboration of three CCH divisions—EMS, Public Health, and CCRM. The initiative collaborates with AMR to provide resources, training, and support to paramedics so they can administer buprenorphine and naloxone in the field and distribute leave-behind naloxone kits with patients and bystanders. The initiative has also established seamless referral pathways to connect OUD patients treated in the field to outpatient MAT and other resources for recovery. The OMRI initiative is instrumental in expanding this model of care to other EMS systems across the state based on lessons learned in Contra Costa County.
 OMRI continues to address several urgent and interrelated challenges in Contra Costa County:
the significant increase in deaths resulting from opioid overdose, a lack of naloxone in areas where
overdoses are likely, the need for increased and ongoing paramedic knowledge regarding the uses and effectiveness of buprenorphine and naloxone, and the need to more effectively connect those
receiving prehospital care for opioid overdose to outpatient MAT for sustained care.
 We have well-established referral pathways from these prehospital interventions
to sustained care through outpatient MAT programs and supportive services. OMRI has made great
progress toward addressing this need. Contra Costa County has established CCRMC (Contra Costa Regional Medical Center- County Hospital) as the designated opioid overdose receiving center, due to our Substance Use Navigators being stationed at this site 7 days a week. In instances where patients are transported to other hospitals within the County either because of proximity or patient preference, the likelihood of engaging the patient in longer-term care is greatly diminished. OMRI has established a pathway for the CCRMC based Substance Use Navigators to contact all opioid related 911 responses following transport to both CCRMC and alternative hospitals within Contra Costa County. 
 The funds being requested are vital to continuing the above work and ensuring the personnel being staffed to focus on this work can continue providing it.

Tucson City Court maintains a Veterans Treatment Court entitled the Regional Municipalities Veterans Treatment Court (RMVTC). The RMVTC offers Veterans an alternative to jail or other consequences that accompany misdemeanor convictions. It is a coordinated effort between the City of Tucson and surrounding jurisdictions. RMVTC offers substance abuse treatment, mental/behavioral health treatment, peer support services, and a mentor program. The RMVTC currently offers treatment and peer services through a variety of Tucson area treatment providers. These services include mental health screening and referrals, trauma therapy for Veterans with underlying PTSD, behavioral health treatment, substance use treatment, state mandated treatment for DUI and Domestic Violence offenses, case management, peer support recovery services, a mentor program, and an evidence-based drug testing protocol. Through the assistance of all program partners, the RMVTC will facilitate retention and regular contact beyond program graduation to help sustain the Veterans' hard-fought recovery. The RMVTC program seeks to assist all eligible persons facing misdemeanor charges within the partner jurisdictions who have served in the United States Military, Reserves, or National Guard regardless of discharge status or eligibility with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Court also assists persons still serving on active duty. Most veterans engaging with the program meet the substance abuse diagnosis or mental health diagnosis with co-occurring substance use.
The above listed costs align with the purpose of the program as explained in the Notice of Funding Opportunity for the 2023 Grants to Expand Substance Use Disorder Treatment Capacity in Adult and Family Treatment Drug Courts program. The NOFO states:  “The purpose of this program is to expand substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and recovery support services in existing drug courts. The program recognizes the need for treatment instead of incarceration for individuals with SUDs. These awards provide a continuum of care, including prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services, for individuals with SUD involved with the courts. Harm reduction services funded under this award must adhere to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other requirements related to such programs or services. Award recipients will be expected to screen and assess clients for the presence of SUD and/or co-occurring substance use and mental disorders, screen for infectious diseases for which those with SUDs are at high risk and provide evidence-based and population appropriate harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services. With this program, SAMHSA aims to improve abstinence from substance use, housing stability, employment status, social connectedness, health/behavioral/social consequences, and reduce criminal justice involvement.”

It serves 4 regional communities in Alaska: Nanwalek, Port Graham, Tatitlek, and Chenega. This grant supports these Tribes in developing culturally relevant, community-led programs that not only address immediate behavioral health needs but also build long-term systems of care. We focus on early intervention and developing sustainable, community-driven solutions.
Chugachmiut’s Native Connections funding supports a full-time, licensed behavioral health clinician dedicated to providing individual and family therapy aimed at reducing suicide and substance use among Alaska Native youth. In addition to clinical services, the clinician leads community-based prevention efforts, with a portion of the supplies budget specifically designated to support events that foster cultural identity, creative expression, and social connection—key protective factors for youth well-being. A substantial portion of the funding is allocated to travel logistics, enabling the clinician to serve multiple remote communities on a consistent basis. Additionally, the grant helps cover the costs of transporting clients to inpatient treatment facilities when specialized care is needed outside the village, ensuring continuity of care and access to critical services.
Without this funding to support prevention programming and early intervention, the risk of suicide, substance misuse, and untreated mental health issues could rise—especially among young people.

 These funds will support the following grant activities in the NoA: 
Goal 1: To increase the capacity of the Berkeley County Prevention Board, its members and identified community partners, through training and mobilization efforts aimed at reducing high-risk behaviors among youth ages 9 to 20 that may contribute to substance misuse. 
Objective 1.2 Increase capacity by training coalition member on substance misuse prevention strategies by September 29, 2025, measured by the number of training and attendees. In April 2025, six SPARx (Stop Prescription Drug Abuse Berkeley County Subcommittee) members, including staff, law enforcement, and representatives from the Coroner’s Office, attended the Rx & Illicit Drug Summit. Additional training opportunities are being explored, and more coalition members are being recruited. Concurrently, 
Objective 1.6 focuses on building youth capacity through prevention education and peer counseling. The PFS Coordinator, trained in the evidence-based LifeSkills program, delivered tailored sessions on underage drinking and opioid/stimulant misuse to students in grades 6–8. The program completed fall and is in process of completing spring semester, with evaluation results pending. In April 2025, the Botvin LifeSkills curriculum was presented to 50 students aged 12 to 14 at Berkeley Alternative and College Park Middle Schools.

Goal 2: To reduce and prevent alcohol use and misuse among youth ages 9 to 20 by implementing evidence-based prevention strategies throughout Berkeley County. Objective 2.5 Increase the number of participating schools in the Berkeley County School District from four to eight by September 29, 2025, tracked through program implementation across elementary, middle, and high schools. PFS staff conducted the LifeSkills program in Fall 2024, with the Spring 2025 sessions currently underway. As part of these efforts, 50 students at Berkeley Alternative and College Park Middle Schools participated in the Botvin LifeSkills curriculum in April 2025.
Goal 3: To reduce and prevent opioid misuse by implementing evidence-based prevention strategies throughout Berkeley County. 
Objective 3.1 Decrease deaths involving opioids by 15% for residents as measured by the Berkeley County Coroner’s Office by September 29, 2025. Current data show a 30.61% reduction in suspected overdoses, with 23 fatal and 103 accidental overdoses recorded between January 1 and April 15, 2025. The PFS staff actively participate in the Berkeley County Overdose Fatality Review Committee, collaborating with peer recovery organizations, EMS, the Coroner’s Office, and law enforcement. Also, Deterra System training was conducted to promote safe medication disposal, and supplies were replenished in April 2025 to maintain community access. Additionally, PFS staff attended a total of 6 health fair/health promotion events serving 610 individuals directly.
Objective 3.2   Decrease opioid-related overdose hospitalizations by 20% for residents as measured by hospital reports and Just Plain Killers database by September 29, 2025. Between 2021 and 2022, hospital reports indicated a 67% drop in drug-related overdoses and a 38% decrease in opioid-related cases. Data from 2023 and 2024 are still pending. A joint overdose and community training session—held in partnership with the Kennedy Center, Goose Creek Police Department, and recovery organization WakeUp Carolina supported this objective by engaging 108 community partners.
Objective 3.3 Increase peer social disapproval of opioid use among youth/young adults by 24% as measured by student surveys, by September 29, 2025. Initial findings from the LifeSkills program reveal increased peer disapproval of non-prescribed use of prescription drugs. Surveys from 2022 and 2023 show a rise in disapproval of sharing or misusing medications among young adults (18–25) and adults (21+). In March 2024, the Communities That Care (CTC) survey was administered to students in grades 7, 9, 10, and 11 to gather further insights. Based on the results, the evidence-based curriculum continues to be implemented. In April 2025, the Botvin LifeSkills curriculum was delivered to 50 students at Berkeley Alternative and College Park Middle Schools.

Youth Outreach Board Report March
1.	Grant Activities 
In March, SAMHSA grant activities included outreach meetings, after-school programming, quarterly grant reporting, data management, and more.
Our outreach team hosted their activities including: 

Teen Tuesday
Teen Tuesdays provide a welcoming and safe environment for youth to connect with friends and socialize. This program serves as a valuable gathering space for participants, allowing them to relax and engage with peers before attending evening practices or games at the school. 
In March, we hosted four Teen Tuesday sessions with an average of approximately 9 participants per session. Tuesdays occur every Tuesday after school from 3:35 PM to 5:30 PM at our Teen Center and is open to all youth ages 12 and up. 

Teen Night
Teen Night offers a welcoming and safe environment for youth to enjoy our Teen Center while feeling free to express themselves in a space free from drugs and bullying. Participants have access to a wide range of activities, including card games, board games, pool, ping pong, basketball, virtual reality, arts and crafts, movies, and video games. The Teen Center plays a critical role in building protective factors for youth, which are key to reducing the risk of suicide. These protective factors include fostering a sense of belonging, increasing self-confidence, promoting positive peer relationships, and developing healthy coping skills. By providing a supportive and structured environment, Teen Night helps youth strengthen their emotional resilience, improve problem-solving abilities, and establish trust with supportive adults.
In March we hosted four Teen nights and saw our numbers double from the previous month to about 21 youth per activity. With all of the school sports ending except track, many of the kids of the community are seeking activities and places to gather and Teen Center is the place to be on Fridays! 
Teen Night takes place every Friday or on the last school day of the week, from 3:35 PM to 8:30 PM, and is open to all youth ages 12 and up.
     
Native Youth Olympics (NYO)
The 2024-25 NYO season kicked off in late October for our Senior athletes and early November for the Juniors, with a great turnout so far. We currently have 34 Junior athletes and 10 Senior athletes actively participating! This season has brought a fresh energy, with the Seniors practicing in the amazing facility at the health club and the Juniors enjoying wall-to-wall mats, creating a dynamic and exciting environment for all.
In March we attended the first Seward NYO Tournament in 8 years! It was the first time any of our coaches or athletes had competed at their tournament. We brought a group of 16 youth to compete with us and the coolest part was we got to sleep at the Sealife Center! The kids absolutely loved that experience, even if it meant sleeping on the floor. The tournament itself went great, the atmosphere was amazing, you could sense the love of NYO and the rich tradition there. Our athletes really showed up for this one, decorating podium after podium, many of them getting a first award! The biggest accomplishment of the weekend was one of our athletes Owen Zell, who received the individual sportsmanship award as a Junior athlete! This is not usual for them to pick such a young athlete, but Owen earned this honor with his sportsmanship and kindness to his peers.
Next stop is the 2025 Senior NYO State Competition! 
NYO is offered to all youth K-12 with Juniors (K-6) practicing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Seniors (7th-12th) practice on Mondays and Wednesdays. Junior practices are held after school from 3:35-5:15 in the school’s hydrogym. While Senior practices take place at the Ninilchik Health and Wellness Club during the same time frame. 
The Native Youth Olympics (NYO) Games consist of ten events based on games that past generations of Alaska Native people played as a way to test their hunting and survival skills, increase strength and agility, and maintain endurance and the balance of mind and body. NYO is part of our afterschool programs and offered to all youth grades K-12. The different games require various skills which allow all youth to find an event that best matches their skills. As youth get older, they begin to master events.
A few benefits of NYO are:	
•	Healthy lifestyles, positive self-esteem, teamwork, and leadership skills
•	Appreciation of Alaska Native traditions
•	Good sportsmanship through friendly athletic competition
•	Cross cultural understanding
      
GULO
GULO is still going strong although we haven’t had much snow for skiing or snowshoeing.  Students have enjoyed playing frisbee golf as well as teaming up with the library’s weekly Dungeons and Dragons club for some team play.  Our last month of school will include plant identification and foraging for early spring edible plants.
Getting Us Leaders Outside (GULO), is a co-sponsored activity between NTC Youth Outreach and Project GRAD. It was designed to help youth connect with positive adult mentors while having enriching outdoor adventures and educational experiences. Studies consistently show when youth work with a mentor, their high school graduation rate increases, self-esteem and confidence boosts, improves interpersonal skills, they become less likely to use drugs and alcohol, and an ongoing list of other benefits. 
In March we hosted three GULO sessions with an average of 8 youth in attendance. 
        
Transportation Assistance: 
In March we have been supporting youth’s extracurricular endeavors by offering transportation to various events. We are primarily helping with the Middle School Wrestling and Volleyball teams by helping them get to their tournaments. Funding can be a barrier for some youth sports and transportation is a large expense. By supporting these programs, they can provide more opportunities for their athletes to compete and grow. 
                              
Sources of Strength: 
Peer Leaders are currently organizing a schoolwide Spirit Week, which will highlight daily themes such as Generosity, Positive Friends, Mentoring and Healthy Activities.  Each day will include a themed activity, and both students and staff are encouraged to participate by dressing in alignment with the daily theme. This will culminate to a schoolwide assembly game show called “mentor madness” where youths selected mentors will compete in fun games. There will also be guest speakers at the school to talk about each portion of the wheel on different days over the next few weeks. 
Sources of Strength is a strength-based, comprehensive wellness program that focuses on suicide prevention but impacts other issues such as substance abuse and violence. The program is based on a relational connections model that uses teams of Peer Leaders mentored by Adult Advisors to change peer social norms about help seeking and encourages students to individually assess and develop strengths in their life.
Sources of Strength is one of the most rigorously evaluated upstream suicide prevention programs. Placed on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) list since 2012, Sources of Strength is an innovative and effective prevention program.
